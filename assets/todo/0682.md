### 题目

You're now a baseball game point recorder.

Given a list of strings, each string can be one of the 4 following types:

1. Integer (one round's score): Directly represents the number of points you get in this round.
2. "+" (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the sum of the last two valid round's points.
3. "D" (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the doubled data of the last valid round's points.
4. "C" (an operation, which isn't a round's score): Represents the last valid round's points you get were invalid and should be removed.
   Each round's operation is permanent and could have an impact on the round before and the round after.

You need to return the sum of the points you could get in all the rounds.

**Example 1**:

```

Input: ["5","2","C","D","+"]
Output: 30
Explanation:
Round 1: You could get 5 points. The sum is: 5.
Round 2: You could get 2 points. The sum is: 7.
Operation 1: The round 2's data was invalid. The sum is: 5.
Round 3: You could get 10 points (the round 2's data has been removed). The sum is: 15.
Round 4: You could get 5 + 10 = 15 points. The sum is: 30.

```

**Example 2**:

```

Input: ["5","-2","4","C","D","9","+","+"]
Output: 27
Explanation:
Round 1: You could get 5 points. The sum is: 5.
Round 2: You could get -2 points. The sum is: 3.
Round 3: You could get 4 points. The sum is: 7.
Operation 1: The round 3's data is invalid. The sum is: 3.
Round 4: You could get -4 points (the round 3's data has been removed). The sum is: -1.
Round 5: You could get 9 points. The sum is: 8.
Round 6: You could get -4 + 9 = 5 points. The sum is 13.
Round 7: You could get 9 + 5 = 14 points. The sum is 27.

```

**Note**:

- The size of the input list will be between 1 and 1000.
- Every integer represented in the list will be between -30000 and 30000.

### 题目大意

这道题是模拟题，给一串数字和操作符。出现数字就直接累加，出现 "C" 就代表栈推出一个元素，相应的总和要减去栈顶的元素。出现 "D" 就代表把前一个元素乘以 2，就得到当前的元素值。再累加。出现 "+" 就代表把前 2 个值求和，得到当前元素的值，再累积。

### 解题思路

这道题用栈模拟即可。

### 代码

```javascript

package leetcode

import "strconv"

func calPoints(ops []string) int {
	stack := make([]int, len(ops))
	top := 0

	for i := 0; i < len(ops); i++ {
		op := ops[i]
		switch op {
		case "+":
			last1 := stack[top-1]
			last2 := stack[top-2]
			stack[top] = last1 + last2
			top++
		case "D":
			last1 := stack[top-1]
			stack[top] = last1 * 2
			top++
		case "C":
			top--
		default:
			stack[top], _ = strconv.Atoi(op)
			top++
		}
	}

	points := 0
	for i := 0; i < top; i++ {
		points += stack[i]
	}
	return points
}

```
