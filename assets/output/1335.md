# [1335. Minimum Difficulty of a Job Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difficulty-of-a-job-schedule/)

## 题目

You want to schedule a list of jobs in `d` days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To
work on the `ith` job, you have to finish all the jobs `j` where `0 <= j <
i`).

You have to finish **at least** one task every day. The difficulty of a job
schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the `d` days. The
difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done on that day.

You are given an integer array `jobDifficulty` and an integer `d`. The
difficulty of the `ith` job is `jobDifficulty[i]`.

Return _the minimum difficulty of a job schedule_. If you cannot find a
schedule for the jobs return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2
>
> Output: 7
>
> Explanation: First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6.
>
> Second day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1.
>
> The difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7

**Example 2:**

> Input: jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4
>
> Output: -1
>
> Explanation: If you finish a job per day you will still have a free day. you cannot find a schedule for the given jobs.

**Example 3:**

> Input: jobDifficulty = [1,1,1], d = 3
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: The schedule is one job per day. total difficulty will be 3.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= jobDifficulty.length <= 300`
- `0 <= jobDifficulty[i] <= 1000`
- `1 <= d <= 10`
