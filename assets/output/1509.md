# [1509. Minimum Difference Between Largest and Smallest Value in Three Moves](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difference-between-largest-and-smallest-value-in-three-moves/)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `nums`.

In one move, you can choose one element of `nums` and change it to **any
value**.

Return _the minimum difference between the largest and smallest value of`nums`
**after performing at most three moves**_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [5,3,2,4]
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation: We can make at most 3 moves.
>
> In the first move, change 2 to 3. nums becomes [5,3,3,4].
>
> In the second move, change 4 to 3. nums becomes [5,3,3,3].
>
> In the third move, change 5 to 3. nums becomes [3,3,3,3].
>
> After performing 3 moves, the difference between the minimum and maximum is 3 - 3 = 0.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [1,5,0,10,14]
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation: We can make at most 3 moves.
>
> In the first move, change 5 to 0. nums becomes [1,0,0,10,14].
>
> In the second move, change 10 to 0. nums becomes [1,0,0,0,14].
>
> In the third move, change 14 to 1. nums becomes [1,0,0,0,1].
>
> After performing 3 moves, the difference between the minimum and maximum is 1 - 0 = 1.
>
> It can be shown that there is no way to make the difference 0 in 3 moves.

**Example 3:**

> Input: nums = [3,100,20]
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation: We can make at most 3 moves.
>
> In the first move, change 100 to 7. nums becomes [3,7,20].
>
> In the second move, change 20 to 7. nums becomes [3,7,7].
>
> In the third move, change 3 to 7. nums becomes [7,7,7].
>
> After performing 3 moves, the difference between the minimum and maximum is 7 - 7 = 0.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
