# [2155. All Divisions With the Highest Score of a Binary Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-divisions-with-the-highest-score-of-a-binary-array)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** binary array `nums` of length `n`. `nums` can be
divided at index `i` (where `0 <= i <= n)` into two arrays (possibly empty)
`numsleft` and `numsright`:

  * `numsleft` has all the elements of `nums` between index `0` and `i - 1` **(inclusive)** , while `numsright` has all the elements of nums between index `i` and `n - 1` **(inclusive)**.
  * If `i == 0`, `numsleft` is **empty** , while `numsright` has all the elements of `nums`.
  * If `i == n`, `numsleft` has all the elements of nums, while `numsright` is **empty**.

The **division score** of an index `i` is the **sum** of the number of `0`'s
in `numsleft` and the number of `1`'s in `numsright`.

Return _**all distinct indices** that have the **highest** possible **division
score**_. You may return the answer in **any order**.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [0,0,1,0]
    **Output:** [2,4]
    **Explanation:** Division at index
    - 0: numsleft is []. numsright is [0,0, _ **1**_ ,0]. The score is 0 + 1 = 1.
    - 1: numsleft is [ _ **0**_ ]. numsright is [0, _ **1**_ ,0]. The score is 1 + 1 = 2.
    - 2: numsleft is [ _ **0**_ , _ **0**_ ]. numsright is [ _ **1**_ ,0]. The score is 2 + 1 = 3.
    - 3: numsleft is [ _ **0**_ , _ **0**_ ,1]. numsright is [0]. The score is 2 + 0 = 2.
    - 4: numsleft is [ _ **0**_ , _ **0**_ ,1, _ **0**_ ]. numsright is []. The score is 3 + 0 = 3.
    Indices 2 and 4 both have the highest possible division score 3.
    Note the answer [4,2] would also be accepted.

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [0,0,0]
    **Output:** [3]
    **Explanation:** Division at index
    - 0: numsleft is []. numsright is [0,0,0]. The score is 0 + 0 = 0.
    - 1: numsleft is [ _ **0**_ ]. numsright is [0,0]. The score is 1 + 0 = 1.
    - 2: numsleft is [ _ **0**_ , _ **0**_ ]. numsright is [0]. The score is 2 + 0 = 2.
    - 3: numsleft is [ _ **0**_ , _ **0**_ , _ **0**_ ]. numsright is []. The score is 3 + 0 = 3.
    Only index 3 has the highest possible division score 3.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [1,1]
    **Output:** [0]
    **Explanation:** Division at index
    - 0: numsleft is []. numsright is [ _ **1**_ , _ **1**_ ]. The score is 0 + 2 = 2.
    - 1: numsleft is [1]. numsright is [ _ **1**_ ]. The score is 0 + 1 = 1.
    - 2: numsleft is [1,1]. numsright is []. The score is 0 + 0 = 0.
    Only index 0 has the highest possible division score 2.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `n == nums.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 105`
  * `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.
