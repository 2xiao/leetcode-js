# [1857. Largest Color Value in a Directed Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-color-value-in-a-directed-graph)

## 题目

There is a **directed graph** of `n` colored nodes and `m` edges. The nodes
are numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given a string `colors` where `colors[i]` is a lowercase English
letter representing the **color** of the `ith` node in this graph (
**0-indexed** ). You are also given a 2D array `edges` where `edges[j] = [aj,
bj]` indicates that there is a **directed edge** from node `aj` to node `bj`.

A valid **path** in the graph is a sequence of nodes `x1 -> x2 -> x3 -> ... ->
xk` such that there is a directed edge from `xi` to `xi+1` for every `1 <= i <
k`. The **color value** of the path is the number of nodes that are colored
the **most frequently** occurring color along that path.

Return _the **largest color value** of any valid path in the given graph, or
_`-1` _if the graph contains a cycle_.



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** colors = "abaca", edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** The path 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 contains 3 nodes that are colored "a" (red in the above image).
    

**Example 2:**

    **Input:** colors = "a", edges = [[0,0]]
    **Output:** -1
    **Explanation:** There is a cycle from 0 to 0.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `n == colors.length`
  * `m == edges.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 105`
  * `0 <= m <= 105`
  * `colors` consists of lowercase English letters.
  * `0 <= aj, bj < n`
