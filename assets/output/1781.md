# [1781. Sum of Beauty of All Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-beauty-of-all-substrings)

## 题目

The **beauty** of a string is the difference in frequencies between the most
frequent and least frequent characters.

  * For example, the beauty of `"abaacc"` is `3 - 1 = 2`.

Given a string `s`, return _the sum of **beauty** of all of its substrings._



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "aabcb"
    **Output:** 5
    **Explanation:** The substrings with non-zero beauty are ["aab","aabc","aabcb","abcb","bcb"], each with beauty equal to 1.

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "aabcbaa"
    **Output:** 17
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 500`
  * `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
