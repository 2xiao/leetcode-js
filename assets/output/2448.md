# [2448. Minimum Cost to Make Array Equal](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-make-array-equal/)

## 题目

You are given two **0-indexed** arrays `nums` and `cost` consisting each of
`n` **positive** integers.

You can do the following operation **any** number of times:

- Increase or decrease **any** element of the array `nums` by `1`.

The cost of doing one operation on the `ith` element is `cost[i]`.

Return _the **minimum** total cost such that all the elements of the array
_`nums` _become **equal**_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [1,3,5,2], cost = [2,3,1,14]
>
> Output: 8
>
> Explanation: We can make all the elements equal to 2 in the following way:
>
> - Increase the 0th element one time. The cost is 2.
> - Decrease the 1st element one time. The cost is 3.
> - Decrease the 2nd element three times. The cost is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
>
> The total cost is 2 + 3 + 3 = 8.
>
> It can be shown that we cannot make the array equal with a smaller cost.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2], cost = [4,2,8,1,3]
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation: All the elements are already equal, so no operations are needed.

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length == cost.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i], cost[i] <= 10^6`
- Test cases are generated in a way that the output doesn't exceed 253-1
