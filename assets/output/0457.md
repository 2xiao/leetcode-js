# [457. Circular Array Loop](https://leetcode.com/problems/circular-array-loop)

## 题目

You are playing a game involving a **circular** array of non-zero integers
`nums`. Each `nums[i]` denotes the number of indices forward/backward you must
move if you are located at index `i`:

  * If `nums[i]` is positive, move `nums[i]` steps **forward** , and
  * If `nums[i]` is negative, move `nums[i]` steps **backward**.

Since the array is **circular** , you may assume that moving forward from the
last element puts you on the first element, and moving backwards from the
first element puts you on the last element.

A **cycle** in the array consists of a sequence of indices `seq` of length `k`
where:

  * Following the movement rules above results in the repeating index sequence `seq[0] -> seq[1] -> ... -> seq[k - 1] -> seq[0] -> ...`
  * Every `nums[seq[j]]` is either **all positive** or **all negative**.
  * `k > 1`

Return `true` _if there is a **cycle** in _`nums` _, or_`false` _otherwise_.



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** nums = [2,-1,1,2,2]
    **Output:** true
    **Explanation:** The graph shows how the indices are connected. White nodes are jumping forward, while red is jumping backward.
    We can see the cycle 0 --> 2 --> 3 --> 0 --> ..., and all of its nodes are white (jumping in the same direction).
    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/09/01/img2.jpg)

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5,6]
    **Output:** false
    **Explanation:** The graph shows how the indices are connected. White nodes are jumping forward, while red is jumping backward.
    The only cycle is of size 1, so we return false.
    

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/09/01/img3.jpg)

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [1,-1,5,1,4]
    **Output:** true
    **Explanation:** The graph shows how the indices are connected. White nodes are jumping forward, while red is jumping backward.
    We can see the cycle 0 --> 1 --> 0 --> ..., and while it is of size > 1, it has a node jumping forward and a node jumping backward, so **it is not a cycle**.
    We can see the cycle 3 --> 4 --> 3 --> ..., and all of its nodes are white (jumping in the same direction).
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
  * `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
  * `nums[i] != 0`



**Follow up:** Could you solve it in `O(n)` time complexity and `O(1)` extra
space complexity?
