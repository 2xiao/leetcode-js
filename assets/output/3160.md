# [3160. Find the Number of Distinct Colors Among the Balls](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-number-of-distinct-colors-among-the-balls/)

## 题目

You are given an integer `limit` and a 2D array `queries` of size `n x 2`.

There are `limit + 1` balls with **distinct** labels in the range `[0,
limit]`. Initially, all balls are uncolored. For every query in `queries` that
is of the form `[x, y]`, you mark ball `x` with the color `y`. After each
query, you need to find the number of **distinct** colors among the balls.

Return an array `result` of length `n`, where `result[i]` denotes the number
of distinct colors _after_ `ith` query.

**Note** that when answering a query, lack of a color _will not_ be considered
as a color.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** limit = 4, queries = [[1,4],[2,5],[1,3],[3,4]]

**Output:** [1,2,2,3]

**Explanation:**

- After query 0, ball 1 has color 4.
- After query 1, ball 1 has color 4, and ball 2 has color 5.
- After query 2, ball 1 has color 3, and ball 2 has color 5.
- After query 3, ball 1 has color 3, ball 2 has color 5, and ball 3 has color 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** limit = 4, queries = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,2],[3,4],[4,5]]

**Output:** [1,2,2,3,4]

**Explanation:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/04/17/ezgifcom-crop2.gif)**

- After query 0, ball 0 has color 1.
- After query 1, ball 0 has color 1, and ball 1 has color 2.
- After query 2, ball 0 has color 1, and balls 1 and 2 have color 2.
- After query 3, ball 0 has color 1, balls 1 and 2 have color 2, and ball 3 has color 4.
- After query 4, ball 0 has color 1, balls 1 and 2 have color 2, ball 3 has color 4, and ball 4 has color 5.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= limit <= 10^9`
- `1 <= n == queries.length <= 10^5`
- `queries[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= queries[i][0] <= limit`
- `1 <= queries[i][1] <= 10^9`
