# [847. Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-visiting-all-nodes)

## 题目

You have an undirected, connected graph of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n -
1`. You are given an array `graph` where `graph[i]` is a list of all the nodes
connected with node `i` by an edge.

Return _the length of the shortest path that visits every node_. You may start
and stop at any node, you may revisit nodes multiple times, and you may reuse
edges.



**Example 1:**

> Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0],[0],[0]]
> 
> Output: 4
> 
> Explanation: One possible path is [1,0,2,0,3]

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/12/shortest2-graph.jpg)

> Input: graph = [[1],[0,2,4],[1,3,4],[2],[1,2]]
> 
> Output: 4
> 
> Explanation: One possible path is [0,1,4,2,3]

**Constraints:**

  * `n == graph.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 12`
  * `0 <= graph[i].length < n`
  * `graph[i]` does not contain `i`.
  * If `graph[a]` contains `b`, then `graph[b]` contains `a`.
  * The input graph is always connected.
