# [1859. Sorting the Sentence](https://leetcode.com/problems/sorting-the-sentence)

## 题目

A **sentence** is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no
leading or trailing spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase
English letters.

A sentence can be **shuffled** by appending the **1-indexed word position** to
each word then rearranging the words in the sentence.

  * For example, the sentence `"This is a sentence"` can be shuffled as `"sentence4 a3 is2 This1"` or `"is2 sentence4 This1 a3"`.

Given a **shuffled sentence** `s` containing no more than `9` words,
reconstruct and return _the original sentence_.



**Example 1:**

> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> **Input:** s = "is2 sentence4 This1 a3"
> 
> Output: "This is a sentence"
> 
> Explanation: Sort the words in s to their original positions "This1 is2 a3 sentence4", then remove the numbers.

**Example 2:**

> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> **Input:** s = "Myself2 Me1 I4 and3"
> 
> Output: "Me Myself and I"
> 
> Explanation: Sort the words in s to their original positions "Me1 Myself2 and3 I4", then remove the numbers.

**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= s.length <= 200`
  * `s` consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters, spaces, and digits from `1` to `9`.
  * The number of words in `s` is between `1` and `9`.
  * The words in `s` are separated by a single space.
  * `s` contains no leading or trailing spaces.
