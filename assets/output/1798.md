# [1798. Maximum Number of Consecutive Values You Can Make](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-consecutive-values-you-can-make)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `coins` of length `n` which represents the `n`
coins that you own. The value of the `ith` coin is `coins[i]`. You can
**make** some value `x` if you can choose some of your `n` coins such that
their values sum up to `x`.

Return the _maximum number of consecutive integer values that you **can**
**make** with your coins **starting** from and **including** _`0`.

Note that you may have multiple coins of the same value.



**Example 1:**

> Input: coins = [1,3]
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: You can make the following values:
> - 0: take []
> - 1: take [1]
> 
> You can make 2 consecutive integer values starting from 0.

**Example 2:**

> Input: coins = [1,1,1,4]
> 
> Output: 8
> 
> Explanation: You can make the following values:
> - 0: take []
> - 1: take [1]
> - 2: take [1,1]
> - 3: take [1,1,1]
> - 4: take [4]
> - 5: take [4,1]
> - 6: take [4,1,1]
> - 7: take [4,1,1,1]
> 
> You can make 8 consecutive integer values starting from 0.

**Example 3:**

> Input: nums = [1,4,10,3,1]
> 
> Output: 20



**Constraints:**

  * `coins.length == n`
  * `1 <= n <= 4 * 104`
  * `1 <= coins[i] <= 4 * 104`
