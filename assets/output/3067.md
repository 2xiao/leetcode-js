# [3067. Count Pairs of Connectable Servers in a Weighted Tree Network](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-pairs-of-connectable-servers-in-a-weighted-tree-network/)

## 题目

You are given an unrooted weighted tree with `n` vertices representing servers
numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi,
weighti]` represents a bidirectional edge between vertices `ai` and `bi` of
weight `weighti`. You are also given an integer `signalSpeed`.

Two servers `a` and `b` are **connectable** through a server `c` if:

- `a < b`, `a != c` and `b != c`.
- The distance from `c` to `a` is divisible by `signalSpeed`.
- The distance from `c` to `b` is divisible by `signalSpeed`.
- The path from `c` to `b` and the path from `c` to `a` do not share any edges.

Return _an integer array_ `count` _of length_ `n` _where_ `count[i]` _is
the**number** of server pairs that are **connectable** through_ _the server_
`i`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/01/21/example22.png)

> Input: edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,5],[2,3,13],[3,4,9],[4,5,2]], signalSpeed = 1
>
> Output: [0,4,6,6,4,0]
>
> Explanation: Since signalSpeed is 1, count[c] is equal to the number of pairs of paths that start at c and do not share any edges.
>
> In the case of the given path graph, count[c] is equal to the number of servers to the left of c multiplied by the servers to the right of c.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/01/21/example11.png)

> Input: edges = [[0,6,3],[6,5,3],[0,3,1],[3,2,7],[3,1,6],[3,4,2]], signalSpeed = 3
>
> Output: [2,0,0,0,0,0,2]
>
> Explanation: Through server 0, there are 2 pairs of connectable servers: (4, 5) and (4, 6).
>
> Through server 6, there are 2 pairs of connectable servers: (4, 5) and (0, 5).
>
> It can be shown that no two servers are connectable through servers other than 0 and 6.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 1000`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `edges[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= ai, bi < n`
- `edges[i] = [ai, bi, weighti]`
- `1 <= weighti <= 10^6`
- `1 <= signalSpeed <= 10^6`
- The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.
