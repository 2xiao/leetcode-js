# [2249. Count Lattice Points Inside a Circle](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-lattice-points-inside-a-circle/)

## 题目

Given a 2D integer array `circles` where `circles[i] = [xi, yi, ri]`
represents the center `(xi, yi)` and radius `ri` of the `ith` circle drawn on
a grid, return _the **number of lattice points** __that are present inside
**at least one** circle_.

**Note:**

  * A **lattice point** is a point with integer coordinates.
  * Points that lie **on the circumference of a circle** are also considered to be inside it.



**Example 1:**

> Input: circles = [[2,2,1]]
> 
> Output: 5
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> The figure above shows the given circle.
> 
> The lattice points present inside the circle are (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 2) and are shown in green.
> 
> Other points such as (1, 1) and (1, 3), which are shown in red, are not considered inside the circle.
> 
> Hence, the number of lattice points present inside at least one circle is 5.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/02/exa-22.png)

> Input: circles = [[2,2,2],[3,4,1]]
> 
> Output: 16
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> The figure above shows the given circles.
> 
> There are exactly 16 lattice points which are present inside at least one circle. 
> 
> Some of them are (0, 2), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 2), and (4, 4).

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= circles.length <= 200`
  * `circles[i].length == 3`
  * `1 <= xi, yi <= 100`
  * `1 <= ri <= min(xi, yi)`
