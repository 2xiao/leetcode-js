# [1411. Number of Ways to Paint N × 3 Grid](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-paint-n-3-grid)

## 题目

You have a `grid` of size `n x 3` and you want to paint each cell of the grid
with exactly one of the three colors: **Red** , **Yellow,** or **Green** while
making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same color (i.e., no two cells
that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same color).

Given `n` the number of rows of the grid, return _the number of ways_ you can
paint this `grid`. As the answer may grow large, the answer **must be**
computed modulo `109 + 7`.



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** n = 1
    **Output:** 12
    **Explanation:** There are 12 possible way to paint the grid as shown.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 5000
    **Output:** 30228214
    



**Constraints:**

  * `n == grid.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 5000`
