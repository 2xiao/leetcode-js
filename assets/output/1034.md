# [1034. Coloring A Border](https://leetcode.com/problems/coloring-a-border)

## 题目

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`, and three integers `row`,
`col`, and `color`. Each value in the grid represents the color of the grid
square at that location.

Two squares are called **adjacent** if they are next to each other in any of
the 4 directions.

Two squares belong to the same **connected component** if they have the same
color and they are adjacent.

The **border of a connected component** is all the squares in the connected
component that are either adjacent to (at least) a square not in the
component, or on the boundary of the grid (the first or last row or column).

You should color the **border** of the **connected component** that contains
the square `grid[row][col]` with `color`.

Return _the final grid_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** grid = [[1,1],[1,2]], row = 0, col = 0, color = 3
    **Output:** [[3,3],[3,2]]
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** grid = [[1,2,2],[2,3,2]], row = 0, col = 1, color = 3
    **Output:** [[1,3,3],[2,3,3]]
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** grid = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]], row = 1, col = 1, color = 2
    **Output:** [[2,2,2],[2,1,2],[2,2,2]]
    



**Constraints:**

  * `m == grid.length`
  * `n == grid[i].length`
  * `1 <= m, n <= 50`
  * `1 <= grid[i][j], color <= 1000`
  * `0 <= row < m`
  * `0 <= col < n`
