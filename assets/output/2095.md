# [2095. Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-the-middle-node-of-a-linked-list/)

## 题目

You are given the `head` of a linked list. **Delete** the **middle node** ,
and return _the_ `head` _of the modified linked list_.

The **middle node** of a linked list of size `n` is the `⌊n / 2⌋th` node from
the **start** using **0-based indexing** , where `⌊x⌋` denotes the largest
integer less than or equal to `x`.

- For `n` = `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, and `5`, the middle nodes are `0`, `1`, `1`, `2`, and `2`, respectively.

**Example 1:**

> Input: head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6]
>
> Output: [1,3,4,1,2,6]
>
> Explanation:
>
> The above figure represents the given linked list. The indices of the nodes are written below.
>
> Since n = 7, node 3 with value 7 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
>
> We return the new list after removing this node.

**Example 2:**

> Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
>
> Output: [1,2,4]
>
> Explanation:
>
> The above figure represents the given linked list.
>
> For n = 4, node 2 with value 3 is the middle node, which is marked in red.

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/16/eg3drawio.png)

> Input: head = [2,1]
>
> Output: [2]
>
> Explanation:
>
> The above figure represents the given linked list.
>
> For n = 2, node 1 with value 1 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
>
> Node 0 with value 2 is the only node remaining after removing node 1.

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 105]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
