# [2454. Next Greater Element IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-iv/)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** array of non-negative integers `nums`. For each
integer in `nums`, you must find its respective **second greater** integer.

The **second greater** integer of `nums[i]` is `nums[j]` such that:

- `j > i`
- `nums[j] > nums[i]`
- There exists **exactly one** index `k` such that `nums[k] > nums[i]` and `i < k < j`.

If there is no such `nums[j]`, the second greater integer is considered to be
`-1`.

- For example, in the array `[1, 2, 4, 3]`, the second greater integer of `1` is `4`, `2` is `3`, and that of `3` and `4` is `-1`.

Return _an integer array_`answer` _, where_`answer[i]` _is the second greater
integer of_`nums[i]` _._

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [2,4,0,9,6]
>
> Output: [9,6,6,-1,-1]
>
> Explanation:
>
> 0th index: 4 is the first integer greater than 2, and 9 is the second integer greater than 2, to the right of 2.
>
> 1st index: 9 is the first, and 6 is the second integer greater than 4, to the right of 4.
>
> 2nd index: 9 is the first, and 6 is the second integer greater than 0, to the right of 0.
>
> 3rd index: There is no integer greater than 9 to its right, so the second greater integer is considered to be -1.
>
> 4th index: There is no integer greater than 6 to its right, so the second greater integer is considered to be -1.
>
> Thus, we return [9,6,6,-1,-1].

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [3,3]
>
> Output: [-1,-1]
>
> Explanation:
>
> We return [-1,-1] since neither integer has any integer greater than it.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
