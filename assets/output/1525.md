# [1525. Number of Good Ways to Split a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-good-ways-to-split-a-string)

## 题目

You are given a string `s`.

A split is called **good** if you can split `s` into two non-empty strings
`sleft` and `sright` where their concatenation is equal to `s` (i.e., `sleft +
sright = s`) and the number of distinct letters in `sleft` and `sright` is the
same.

Return _the number of **good splits** you can make in `s`_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "aacaba"
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** There are 5 ways to split "aacaba" and 2 of them are good. 
    ("a", "acaba") Left string and right string contains 1 and 3 different letters respectively.
    ("aa", "caba") Left string and right string contains 1 and 3 different letters respectively.
    ("aac", "aba") Left string and right string contains 2 and 2 different letters respectively (good split).
    ("aaca", "ba") Left string and right string contains 2 and 2 different letters respectively (good split).
    ("aacab", "a") Left string and right string contains 3 and 1 different letters respectively.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "abcd"
    **Output:** 1
    **Explanation:** Split the string as follows ("ab", "cd").
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
