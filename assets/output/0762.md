# [762. Prime Number of Set Bits in Binary Representation](https://leetcode.com/problems/prime-number-of-set-bits-in-binary-representation/)

## 题目

Given two integers `left` and `right`, return _the **count** of numbers in the
**inclusive** range _`[left, right]` _having a **prime number of set bits** in
their binary representation_.

Recall that the **number of set bits** an integer has is the number of `1`'s
present when written in binary.

  * For example, `21` written in binary is `10101`, which has `3` set bits.



**Example 1:**

> Input: left = 6, right = 10
> 
> Output: 4
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> 6  -> 110 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
> 
> 7  -> 111 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
> 
> 8  -> 1000 (1 set bit, 1 is not prime)
> 
> 9  -> 1001 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
> 
> 10 -> 1010 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
> 
> 4 numbers have a prime number of set bits.

**Example 2:**

> Input: left = 10, right = 15
> 
> Output: 5
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> 10 -> 1010 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
> 
> 11 -> 1011 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
> 
> 12 -> 1100 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
> 
> 13 -> 1101 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
> 
> 14 -> 1110 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
> 
> 15 -> 1111 (4 set bits, 4 is not prime)
> 
> 5 numbers have a prime number of set bits.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= left <= right <= 106`
  * `0 <= right - left <= 104`
