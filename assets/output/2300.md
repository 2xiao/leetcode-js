# [2300. Successful Pairs of Spells and Potions](https://leetcode.com/problems/successful-pairs-of-spells-and-potions)

## 题目

You are given two positive integer arrays `spells` and `potions`, of length
`n` and `m` respectively, where `spells[i]` represents the strength of the
`ith` spell and `potions[j]` represents the strength of the `jth` potion.

You are also given an integer `success`. A spell and potion pair is considered
**successful** if the **product** of their strengths is **at least**
`success`.

Return _an integer array_`pairs` _of length_`n` _where_`pairs[i]` _is the
number of **potions** that will form a successful pair with the _`ith`
_spell._



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** spells = [5,1,3], potions = [1,2,3,4,5], success = 7
    **Output:** [4,0,3]
    **Explanation:**
    - 0th spell: 5 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [5, _ **10**_ , _ **15**_ , _ **20**_ , _ **25**_ ]. 4 pairs are successful.
    - 1st spell: 1 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [1,2,3,4,5]. 0 pairs are successful.
    - 2nd spell: 3 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [3,6, _ **9**_ , _ **12**_ , _ **15**_ ]. 3 pairs are successful.
    Thus, [4,0,3] is returned.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** spells = [3,1,2], potions = [8,5,8], success = 16
    **Output:** [2,0,2]
    **Explanation:**
    - 0th spell: 3 * [8,5,8] = [ _ **24**_ ,15, _ **24**_ ]. 2 pairs are successful.
    - 1st spell: 1 * [8,5,8] = [8,5,8]. 0 pairs are successful. 
    - 2nd spell: 2 * [8,5,8] = [ ** _16_** ,10, _ **16**_ ]. 2 pairs are successful. 
    Thus, [2,0,2] is returned.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `n == spells.length`
  * `m == potions.length`
  * `1 <= n, m <= 105`
  * `1 <= spells[i], potions[i] <= 105`
  * `1 <= success <= 1010`
