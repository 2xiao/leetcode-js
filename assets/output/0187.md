# [187. Repeated DNA Sequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences)

## 题目

The **DNA sequence** is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as
`'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`.

  * For example, `"ACGAATTCCG"` is a **DNA sequence**.

When studying **DNA** , it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the
DNA.

Given a string `s` that represents a **DNA sequence** , return all the
**`10`-letter-long** sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA
molecule. You may return the answer in **any order**.



**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
> 
> Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"
> 
> Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `s[i]` is either `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, or `'T'`.
