# [2120. Execution of All Suffix Instructions Staying in a Grid](https://leetcode.com/problems/execution-of-all-suffix-instructions-staying-in-a-grid)

## 题目

There is an `n x n` grid, with the top-left cell at `(0, 0)` and the bottom-
right cell at `(n - 1, n - 1)`. You are given the integer `n` and an integer
array `startPos` where `startPos = [startrow, startcol]` indicates that a
robot is initially at cell `(startrow, startcol)`.

You are also given a **0-indexed** string `s` of length `m` where `s[i]` is
the `ith` instruction for the robot: `'L'` (move left), `'R'` (move right),
`'U'` (move up), and `'D'` (move down).

The robot can begin executing from any `ith` instruction in `s`. It executes
the instructions one by one towards the end of `s` but it stops if either of
these conditions is met:

  * The next instruction will move the robot off the grid.
  * There are no more instructions left to execute.

Return _an array_ `answer` _of length_ `m` _where_ `answer[i]` _is **the
number of instructions** the robot can execute if the robot **begins executing
from** the_ `ith` _instruction in_ `s`.



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** n = 3, startPos = [0,1], s = "RRDDLU"
    **Output:** [1,5,4,3,1,0]
    **Explanation:** Starting from startPos and beginning execution from the ith instruction:
    - 0th: " _ **R**_ RDDLU". Only one instruction "R" can be executed before it moves off the grid.
    - 1st:  " _ **RDDLU**_ ". All five instructions can be executed while it stays in the grid and ends at (1, 1).
    - 2nd:   " _ **DDLU**_ ". All four instructions can be executed while it stays in the grid and ends at (1, 0).
    - 3rd:    " _ **DLU**_ ". All three instructions can be executed while it stays in the grid and ends at (0, 0).
    - 4th:     " _ **L**_ U". Only one instruction "L" can be executed before it moves off the grid.
    - 5th:      "U". If moving up, it would move off the grid.
    

**Example 2:**

    **Input:** n = 2, startPos = [1,1], s = "LURD"
    **Output:** [4,1,0,0]
    **Explanation:**
    - 0th: " _ **LURD**_ ".
    - 1st:  " _ **U**_ RD".
    - 2nd:   "RD".
    - 3rd:    "D".
    

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/09/3.png)

    
    
    **Input:** n = 1, startPos = [0,0], s = "LRUD"
    **Output:** [0,0,0,0]
    **Explanation:** No matter which instruction the robot begins execution from, it would move off the grid.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `m == s.length`
  * `1 <= n, m <= 500`
  * `startPos.length == 2`
  * `0 <= startrow, startcol < n`
  * `s` consists of `'L'`, `'R'`, `'U'`, and `'D'`.
