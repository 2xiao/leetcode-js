# [1970. Last Day Where You Can Still Cross](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-day-where-you-can-still-cross)

## 题目

There is a **1-based** binary matrix where `0` represents land and `1`
represents water. You are given integers `row` and `col` representing the
number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively.

Initially on day `0`, the **entire** matrix is **land**. However, each day a
new cell becomes flooded with **water**. You are given a **1-based** 2D array
`cells`, where `cells[i] = [ri, ci]` represents that on the `ith` day, the
cell on the `rith` row and `cith` column ( **1-based** coordinates) will be
covered with **water** (i.e., changed to `1`).

You want to find the **last** day that it is possible to walk from the **top**
to the **bottom** by only walking on land cells. You can start from **any**
cell in the top row and end at **any** cell in the bottom row. You can only
travel in the **four** cardinal directions (left, right, up, and down).

Return _the **last** day where it is possible to walk from the **top** to the
**bottom** by only walking on land cells_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: row = 2, col = 2, cells = [[1,1],[2,1],[1,2],[2,2]]
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: The above image depicts how the matrix changes each day starting from day 0.
> 
> The last day where it is possible to cross from top to bottom is on day 2.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/27/2.png)

> Input: row = 2, col = 2, cells = [[1,1],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
> 
> Output: 1
> 
> Explanation: The above image depicts how the matrix changes each day starting from day 0.
> 
> The last day where it is possible to cross from top to bottom is on day 1.

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/27/3.png)

> Input: row = 3, col = 3, cells = [[1,2],[2,1],[3,3],[2,2],[1,1],[1,3],[2,3],[3,2],[3,1]]
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation: The above image depicts how the matrix changes each day starting from day 0.
> 
> The last day where it is possible to cross from top to bottom is on day 3.

**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= row, col <= 2 * 104`
  * `4 <= row * col <= 2 * 104`
  * `cells.length == row * col`
  * `1 <= ri <= row`
  * `1 <= ci <= col`
  * All the values of `cells` are **unique**.
