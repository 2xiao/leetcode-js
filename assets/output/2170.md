# [2170. Minimum Operations to Make the Array Alternating](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-the-array-alternating)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` consisting of `n` positive
integers.

The array `nums` is called **alternating** if:

  * `nums[i - 2] == nums[i]`, where `2 <= i <= n - 1`.
  * `nums[i - 1] != nums[i]`, where `1 <= i <= n - 1`.

In one **operation** , you can choose an index `i` and **change** `nums[i]`
into **any** positive integer.

Return _the **minimum number of operations** required to make the array
alternating_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [3,1,3,2,4,3]
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> One way to make the array alternating is by converting it to [3,1,3, _ **1**_ , _ **3**_ , _ **1**_ ].
> 
> The number of operations required in this case is 3.
> 
> It can be proven that it is not possible to make the array alternating in less than 3 operations. 

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [1,2,2,2,2]
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> One way to make the array alternating is by converting it to [1,2, _ **1**_ ,2, _ **1**_ ].
> 
> The number of operations required in this case is 2.
> 
> Note that the array cannot be converted to [ _ **2**_ ,2,2,2,2] because in this case nums[0] == nums[1] which violates the conditions of an alternating array.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 105`
