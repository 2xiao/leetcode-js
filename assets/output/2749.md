# [2749. Minimum Operations to Make the Integer Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-the-integer-zero)

## 题目

You are given two integers `num1` and `num2`.

In one operation, you can choose integer `i` in the range `[0, 60]` and
subtract `2i + num2` from `num1`.

Return _the integer denoting the **minimum** number of operations needed to
make_ `num1` _equal to_ `0`.

If it is impossible to make `num1` equal to `0`, return `-1`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** num1 = 3, num2 = -2
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** We can make 3 equal to 0 with the following operations:
    - We choose i = 2 and substract 22 + (-2) from 3, 3 - (4 + (-2)) = 1.
    - We choose i = 2 and substract 22 + (-2) from 1, 1 - (4 + (-2)) = -1.
    - We choose i = 0 and substract 20 + (-2) from -1, (-1) - (1 + (-2)) = 0.
    It can be proven, that 3 is the minimum number of operations that we need to perform.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** num1 = 5, num2 = 7
    **Output:** -1
    **Explanation:** It can be proven, that it is impossible to make 5 equal to 0 with the given operation.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= num1 <= 109`
  * `-109 <= num2 <= 109`
