# [1673. Find the Most Competitive Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-most-competitive-subsequence/)

## 题目

Given an integer array `nums` and a positive integer `k`, return _the most
**competitive** subsequence of _`nums` _of size_`k`.

An array's subsequence is a resulting sequence obtained by erasing some
(possibly zero) elements from the array.

We define that a subsequence `a` is more **competitive** than a subsequence
`b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ,
subsequence `a` has a number **less** than the corresponding number in `b`.
For example, `[1,3,4]` is more competitive than `[1,3,5]` because the first
position they differ is at the final number, and `4` is less than `5`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [3,5,2,6], k = 2
>
> Output: [2,6]
>
> Explanation: Among the set of every possible subsequence: {[3,5], [3,2], [3,6], [5,2], [5,6], [2,6]}, [2,6] is the most competitive.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [2,4,3,3,5,4,9,6], k = 4
>
> Output: [2,3,3,4]

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= k <= nums.length`
