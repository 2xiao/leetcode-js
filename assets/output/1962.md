# [1962. Remove Stones to Minimize the Total](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-stones-to-minimize-the-total)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `piles`, where `piles[i]`
represents the number of stones in the `ith` pile, and an integer `k`. You
should apply the following operation **exactly** `k` times:

  * Choose any `piles[i]` and **remove** `floor(piles[i] / 2)` stones from it.

**Notice** that you can apply the operation on the **same** pile more than
once.

Return _the **minimum** possible total number of stones remaining after
applying the _`k` _operations_.

`floor(x)` is the **greatest** integer that is **smaller** than or **equal**
to `x` (i.e., rounds `x` down).



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** piles = [5,4,9], k = 2
    **Output:** 12
    **Explanation:**  Steps of a possible scenario are:
    - Apply the operation on pile 2. The resulting piles are [5,4, _5_ ].
    - Apply the operation on pile 0. The resulting piles are [ _3_ ,4,5].
    The total number of stones in [3,4,5] is 12.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** piles = [4,3,6,7], k = 3
    **Output:** 12
    **Explanation:**  Steps of a possible scenario are:
    - Apply the operation on pile 2. The resulting piles are [4,3, _3_ ,7].
    - Apply the operation on pile 3. The resulting piles are [4,3,3, _4_ ].
    - Apply the operation on pile 0. The resulting piles are [ _2_ ,3,3,4].
    The total number of stones in [2,3,3,4] is 12.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= piles.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= piles[i] <= 104`
  * `1 <= k <= 105`
