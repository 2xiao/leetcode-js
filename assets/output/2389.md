# [2389. Longest Subsequence With Limited Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subsequence-with-limited-sum/)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, and an integer array
`queries` of length `m`.

Return _an array_`answer` _of length_`m` _where_`answer[i]` _is the
**maximum** size of a **subsequence** that you can take from _`nums` _such
that the **sum** of its elements is less than or equal to _`queries[i]`.

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by
deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining
elements.

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [4,5,2,1], queries = [3,10,21]
>
> Output: [2,3,4]
>
> Explanation: We answer the queries as follows:
>
> - The subsequence [2,1] has a sum less than or equal to 3. It can be proven that 2 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[0] = 2.
> - The subsequence [4,5,1] has a sum less than or equal to 10. It can be proven that 3 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[1] = 3.
> - The subsequence [4,5,2,1] has a sum less than or equal to 21. It can be proven that 4 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[2] = 4.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [2,3,4,5], queries = [1]
>
> Output: [0]
>
> Explanation: The empty subsequence is the only subsequence that has a sum less than or equal to 1, so answer[0] = 0.

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `m == queries.length`
- `1 <= n, m <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i], queries[i] <= 10^6`
