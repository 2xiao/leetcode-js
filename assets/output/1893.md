# [1893. Check if All the Integers in a Range Are Covered](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-all-the-integers-in-a-range-are-covered)

## 题目

You are given a 2D integer array `ranges` and two integers `left` and `right`.
Each `ranges[i] = [starti, endi]` represents an **inclusive** interval between
`starti` and `endi`.

Return `true` _if each integer in the inclusive range_ `[left, right]` _is
covered by **at least one** interval in_ `ranges`. Return `false` _otherwise_.

An integer `x` is covered by an interval `ranges[i] = [starti, endi]` if
`starti <= x <= endi`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** ranges = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]], left = 2, right = 5
    **Output:** true
    **Explanation:** Every integer between 2 and 5 is covered:
    - 2 is covered by the first range.
    - 3 and 4 are covered by the second range.
    - 5 is covered by the third range.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** ranges = [[1,10],[10,20]], left = 21, right = 21
    **Output:** false
    **Explanation:** 21 is not covered by any range.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= ranges.length <= 50`
  * `1 <= starti <= endi <= 50`
  * `1 <= left <= right <= 50`
