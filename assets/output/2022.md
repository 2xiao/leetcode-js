# [2022. Convert 1D Array Into 2D Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-1d-array-into-2d-array/)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** 1-dimensional (1D) integer array `original`, and
two integers, `m` and `n`. You are tasked with creating a 2-dimensional (2D)
array with ` m` rows and `n` columns using **all** the elements from
`original`.

The elements from indices `0` to `n - 1` ( **inclusive** ) of `original`
should form the first row of the constructed 2D array, the elements from
indices `n` to `2 * n - 1` ( **inclusive** ) should form the second row of the
constructed 2D array, and so on.

Return _an_`m x n` _2D array constructed according to the above procedure, or
an empty 2D array if it is impossible_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: original = [1,2,3,4], m = 2, n = 2
>
> Output: [[1,2],[3,4]]
>
> Explanation: The constructed 2D array should contain 2 rows and 2 columns.
>
> The first group of n=2 elements in original, [1,2], becomes the first row in the constructed 2D array.
>
> The second group of n=2 elements in original, [3,4], becomes the second row in the constructed 2D array.

**Example 2:**

> Input: original = [1,2,3], m = 1, n = 3
>
> Output: [[1,2,3]]
>
> Explanation: The constructed 2D array should contain 1 row and 3 columns.
>
> Put all three elements in original into the first row of the constructed 2D array.

**Example 3:**

> Input: original = [1,2], m = 1, n = 1
>
> Output: []
>
> Explanation: There are 2 elements in original.
>
> It is impossible to fit 2 elements in a 1x1 2D array, so return an empty 2D array.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= original.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `1 <= original[i] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= m, n <= 4 * 10^4`
