# [2045. Second Minimum Time to Reach Destination](https://leetcode.com/problems/second-minimum-time-to-reach-destination)

## 题目

A city is represented as a **bi-directional connected** graph with `n`
vertices where each vertex is labeled from `1` to `n` ( **inclusive** ). The
edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array `edges`, where each
`edges[i] = [ui, vi]` denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex `ui` and
vertex `vi`. Every vertex pair is connected by **at most one** edge, and no
vertex has an edge to itself. The time taken to traverse any edge is `time`
minutes.

Each vertex has a traffic signal which changes its color from **green** to
**red** and vice versa every `change` minutes. All signals change **at the
same time**. You can enter a vertex at **any time** , but can leave a vertex
**only when the signal is green**. You **cannot wait** at a vertex if the
signal is **green**.

The **second minimum value** is defined as the smallest value **strictly
larger** than the minimum value.

  * For example the second minimum value of `[2, 3, 4]` is `3`, and the second minimum value of `[2, 2, 4]` is `4`.

Given `n`, `edges`, `time`, and `change`, return _the **second minimum time**
it will take to go from vertex _`1` _to vertex_`n`.

**Notes:**

  * You can go through any vertex **any** number of times, **including** `1` and `n`.
  * You can assume that when the journey **starts** , all signals have just turned **green**.



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** n = 5, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[3,4],[4,5]], time = 3, change = 5
    **Output:** 13
    **Explanation:**
    The figure on the left shows the given graph.
    The blue path in the figure on the right is the minimum time path.
    The time taken is:
    - Start at 1, time elapsed=0
    - 1 -> 4: 3 minutes, time elapsed=3
    - 4 -> 5: 3 minutes, time elapsed=6
    Hence the minimum time needed is 6 minutes.
    
    The red path shows the path to get the second minimum time.
    - Start at 1, time elapsed=0
    - 1 -> 3: 3 minutes, time elapsed=3
    - 3 -> 4: 3 minutes, time elapsed=6
    - Wait at 4 for 4 minutes, time elapsed=10
    - 4 -> 5: 3 minutes, time elapsed=13
    Hence the second minimum time is 13 minutes.      
    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/29/eg2.png)

    
    
    **Input:** n = 2, edges = [[1,2]], time = 3, change = 2
    **Output:** 11
    **Explanation:**
    The minimum time path is 1 -> 2 with time = 3 minutes.
    The second minimum time path is 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 with time = 11 minutes.



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= n <= 104`
  * `n - 1 <= edges.length <= min(2 * 104, n * (n - 1) / 2)`
  * `edges[i].length == 2`
  * `1 <= ui, vi <= n`
  * `ui != vi`
  * There are no duplicate edges.
  * Each vertex can be reached directly or indirectly from every other vertex.
  * `1 <= time, change <= 103`
