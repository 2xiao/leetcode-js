# [1195. Fizz Buzz Multithreaded](https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz-multithreaded)

## 题目

You have the four functions:

  * `printFizz` that prints the word `"fizz"` to the console,
  * `printBuzz` that prints the word `"buzz"` to the console,
  * `printFizzBuzz` that prints the word `"fizzbuzz"` to the console, and
  * `printNumber` that prints a given integer to the console.

You are given an instance of the class `FizzBuzz` that has four functions:
`fizz`, `buzz`, `fizzbuzz` and `number`. The same instance of `FizzBuzz` will
be passed to four different threads:

  * **Thread A:** calls `fizz()` that should output the word `"fizz"`.
  * **Thread B:** calls `buzz()` that should output the word `"buzz"`.
  * **Thread C:** calls `fizzbuzz()` that should output the word `"fizzbuzz"`.
  * **Thread D:** calls `number()` that should only output the integers.

Modify the given class to output the series `[1, 2, "fizz", 4, "buzz", ...]`
where the `ith` token ( **1-indexed** ) of the series is:

  * `"fizzbuzz"` if `i` is divisible by `3` and `5`,
  * `"fizz"` if `i` is divisible by `3` and not `5`,
  * `"buzz"` if `i` is divisible by `5` and not `3`, or
  * `i` if `i` is not divisible by `3` or `5`.

Implement the `FizzBuzz` class:

  * `FizzBuzz(int n)` Initializes the object with the number `n` that represents the length of the sequence that should be printed.
  * `void fizz(printFizz)` Calls `printFizz` to output `"fizz"`.
  * `void buzz(printBuzz)` Calls `printBuzz` to output `"buzz"`.
  * `void fizzbuzz(printFizzBuzz)` Calls `printFizzBuzz` to output `"fizzbuzz"`.
  * `void number(printNumber)` Calls `printnumber` to output the numbers.



**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 15
> 
> Output: [1,2,"fizz",4,"buzz","fizz",7,8,"fizz","buzz",11,"fizz",13,14,"fizzbuzz"]

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 5
> 
> Output: [1,2,"fizz",4,"buzz"]

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 50`
