# [2024. Maximize the Confusion of an Exam](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-the-confusion-of-an-exam/)

## 题目

A teacher is writing a test with `n` true/false questions, with `'T'` denoting
true and `'F'` denoting false. He wants to confuse the students by
**maximizing** the number of **consecutive** questions with the **same**
answer (multiple trues or multiple falses in a row).

You are given a string `answerKey`, where `answerKey[i]` is the original
answer to the `ith` question. In addition, you are given an integer `k`, the
maximum number of times you may perform the following operation:

- Change the answer key for any question to `'T'` or `'F'` (i.e., set `answerKey[i]` to `'T'` or `'F'`).

Return _the **maximum** number of consecutive_ `'T'`s or `'F'`s _in the answer
key after performing the operation at most_ `k` _times_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: answerKey = "TTFF", k = 2
>
> Output: 4
>
> Explanation: We can replace both the 'F's with 'T's to make answerKey = " _TTTT_ ".
>
> There are four consecutive 'T's.

**Example 2:**

> Input: answerKey = "TFFT", k = 1
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: We can replace the first 'T' with an 'F' to make answerKey = " _FFF_ T".
>
> Alternatively, we can replace the second 'T' with an 'F' to make answerKey = "T _FFF_ ".
>
> In both cases, there are three consecutive 'F's.

**Example 3:**

> Input: answerKey = "TTFTTFTT", k = 1
>
> Output: 5
>
> Explanation: We can replace the first 'F' to make answerKey = " _TTTTT_ FTT"
>
> Alternatively, we can replace the second 'F' to make answerKey = "TTF _TTTTT_ ".
>
> In both cases, there are five consecutive 'T's.

**Constraints:**

- `n == answerKey.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
- `answerKey[i]` is either `'T'` or `'F'`
- `1 <= k <= n`
