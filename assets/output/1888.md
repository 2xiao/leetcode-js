# [1888. Minimum Number of Flips to Make the Binary String Alternating](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-flips-to-make-the-binary-string-alternating)

## 题目

You are given a binary string `s`. You are allowed to perform two types of
operations on the string in any sequence:

  * **Type-1: Remove** the character at the start of the string `s` and **append** it to the end of the string.
  * **Type-2: Pick** any character in `s` and **flip** its value, i.e., if its value is `'0'` it becomes `'1'` and vice-versa.

Return _the **minimum** number of **type-2** operations you need to perform_
_such that_`s` _becomes **alternating**._

The string is called **alternating** if no two adjacent characters are equal.

  * For example, the strings `"010"` and `"1010"` are alternating, while the string `"0100"` is not.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "111000"
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation** : Use the first operation two times to make s = "100011".
    Then, use the second operation on the third and sixth elements to make s = "10 _1_ 01 _0_ ".
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "010"
    **Output:** 0
    **Explanation** : The string is already alternating.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "1110"
    **Output:** 1
    **Explanation** : Use the second operation on the second element to make s = "1 _0_ 10".
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
