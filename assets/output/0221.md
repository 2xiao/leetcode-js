# [221. Maximal Square](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-square)

## 题目

Given an `m x n` binary `matrix` filled with `0`'s and `1`'s, _find the
largest square containing only_ `1`'s _and return its area_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
> 
> Output: 4

**Example 2:**

> Input: matrix = [["0","1"],["1","0"]]
> 
> Output: 1

**Example 3:**

> Input: matrix = [["0"]]
> 
> Output: 0

**Constraints:**

  * `m == matrix.length`
  * `n == matrix[i].length`
  * `1 <= m, n <= 300`
  * `matrix[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.
