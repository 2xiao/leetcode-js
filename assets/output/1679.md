# [1679. Max Number of K-Sum Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-number-of-k-sum-pairs/)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals `k`
and remove them from the array.

Return _the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: Starting with nums = [1,2,3,4]:
>
> - Remove numbers 1 and 4, then nums = [2,3]
> - Remove numbers 2 and 3, then nums = []
>
> There are no more pairs that sum up to 5, hence a total of 2 operations.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,3], k = 6
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation: Starting with nums = [3,1,3,4,3]:
>
> - Remove the first two 3's, then nums = [1,4,3]
>
> There are no more pairs that sum up to 6, hence a total of 1 operation.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= k <= 10^9`
