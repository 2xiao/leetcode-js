# [943. Find the Shortest Superstring](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-shortest-superstring)

## 题目

Given an array of strings `words`, return _the smallest string that contains
each string in_ `words` _as a substring_. If there are multiple valid strings
of the smallest length, return **any of them**.

You may assume that no string in `words` is a substring of another string in
`words`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** words = ["alex","loves","leetcode"]
    **Output:** "alexlovesleetcode"
    **Explanation:** All permutations of "alex","loves","leetcode" would also be accepted.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** words = ["catg","ctaagt","gcta","ttca","atgcatc"]
    **Output:** "gctaagttcatgcatc"
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= words.length <= 12`
  * `1 <= words[i].length <= 20`
  * `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
  * All the strings of `words` are **unique**.
