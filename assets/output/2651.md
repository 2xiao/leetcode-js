# [2651. Calculate Delayed Arrival Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/calculate-delayed-arrival-time)

## 题目

You are given a positive integer `arrivalTime` denoting the arrival time of a
train in hours, and another positive integer `delayedTime` denoting the amount
of delay in hours.

Return _the time when the train will arrive at the station._

Note that the time in this problem is in 24-hours format.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** arrivalTime = 15, delayedTime = 5 
    **Output:** 20 
    **Explanation:** Arrival time of the train was 15:00 hours. It is delayed by 5 hours. Now it will reach at 15+5 = 20 (20:00 hours).
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** arrivalTime = 13, delayedTime = 11
    **Output:** 0
    **Explanation:** Arrival time of the train was 13:00 hours. It is delayed by 11 hours. Now it will reach at 13+11=24 (Which is denoted by 00:00 in 24 hours format so return 0).
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= arrivaltime < 24`
  * `1 <= delayedTime <= 24`
