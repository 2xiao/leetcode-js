# [3112. Minimum Time to Visit Disappearing Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-visit-disappearing-nodes/)

## 题目

There is an undirected graph of `n` nodes. You are given a 2D array `edges`,
where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, lengthi]` describes an edge between node `ui` and
node `vi` with a traversal time of `lengthi` units.

Additionally, you are given an array `disappear`, where `disappear[i]` denotes
the time when the node `i` disappears from the graph and you won't be able to
visit it.

**Note** that the graph might be _disconnected_ and might contain _multiple
edges_.

Return the array `answer`, with `answer[i]` denoting the **minimum** units of
time required to reach node `i` from node 0. If node `i` is **unreachable**
from node 0 then `answer[i]` is `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1,2],[1,2,1],[0,2,4]], disappear = [1,1,5]

**Output:** [0,-1,4]

We are starting our journey from node 0, and our goal is to find the minimum
time required to reach each node before it disappears.

- For node 0, we don't need any time as it is our starting point.
- For node 1, we need at least 2 units of time to traverse `edges[0]`. Unfortunately, it disappears at that moment, so we won't be able to visit it.
- For node 2, we need at least 4 units of time to traverse `edges[2]`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1,2],[1,2,1],[0,2,4]], disappear = [1,3,5]

**Output:** [0,2,3]

We are starting our journey from node 0, and our goal is to find the minimum
time required to reach each node before it disappears.

- For node 0, we don't need any time as it is the starting point.
- For node 1, we need at least 2 units of time to traverse `edges[0]`.
- For node 2, we need at least 3 units of time to traverse `edges[0]` and `edges[1]`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 2, edges = [[0,1,1]], disappear = [1,1]

**Output:** [0,-1]

**Explanation:**

Exactly when we reach node 1, it disappears.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
- `0 <= edges.length <= 10^5`
- `edges[i] == [ui, vi, lengthi]`
- `0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1`
- `1 <= lengthi <= 10^5`
- `disappear.length == n`
- `1 <= disappear[i] <= 10^5`
