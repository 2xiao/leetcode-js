# [1722. Minimize Hamming Distance After Swap Operations](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-hamming-distance-after-swap-operations/)

## 题目

You are given two integer arrays, `source` and `target`, both of length `n`.
You are also given an array `allowedSwaps` where each `allowedSwaps[i] = [ai,
bi]` indicates that you are allowed to swap the elements at index `ai` and
index `bi` **(0-indexed)** of array `source`. Note that you can swap elements
at a specific pair of indices **multiple** times and in **any** order.

The **Hamming distance** of two arrays of the same length, `source` and
`target`, is the number of positions where the elements are different.
Formally, it is the number of indices `i` for `0 <= i <= n-1` where `source[i]
!= target[i]` **(0-indexed)**.

Return _the **minimum Hamming distance** of _`source` _and_`target` _after
performing **any** amount of swap operations on array _`source` _._



**Example 1:**

> Input: source = [1,2,3,4], target = [2,1,4,5], allowedSwaps = [[0,1],[2,3]]
> 
> Output: 1
> 
> Explanation: source can be transformed the following way:
> - Swap indices 0 and 1: source = [ _2_ , _1_ ,3,4]
> - Swap indices 2 and 3: source = [2,1, _4_ , _3_ ]
> 
> The Hamming distance of source and target is 1 as they differ in 1 position: index 3.

**Example 2:**

> Input: source = [1,2,3,4], target = [1,3,2,4], allowedSwaps = []
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: There are no allowed swaps.
> 
> The Hamming distance of source and target is 2 as they differ in 2 positions: index 1 and index 2.

**Example 3:**

> Input: source = [5,1,2,4,3], target = [1,5,4,2,3], allowedSwaps = [[0,4],[4,2],[1,3],[1,4]]
> 
> Output: 0

**Constraints:**

  * `n == source.length == target.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 105`
  * `1 <= source[i], target[i] <= 105`
  * `0 <= allowedSwaps.length <= 105`
  * `allowedSwaps[i].length == 2`
  * `0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1`
  * `ai != bi`
