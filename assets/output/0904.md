# [904. Fruit Into Baskets](https://leetcode.com/problems/fruit-into-baskets)

## 题目

You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from
left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array `fruits` where
`fruits[i]` is the **type** of fruit the `ith` tree produces.

You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some
strict rules that you must follow:

  * You only have **two** baskets, and each basket can only hold a **single type** of fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
  * Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick **exactly one fruit** from **every** tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
  * Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.

Given the integer array `fruits`, return _the **maximum** number of fruits you
can pick_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** fruits = [ _1,2,1_ ]
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** We can pick from all 3 trees.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** fruits = [0, _1,2,2_ ]
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** We can pick from trees [1,2,2].
    If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [0,1].
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** fruits = [1, _2,3,2,2_ ]
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** We can pick from trees [2,3,2,2].
    If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [1,2].
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= fruits.length <= 105`
  * `0 <= fruits[i] < fruits.length`
