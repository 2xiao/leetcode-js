# [1208. Get Equal Substrings Within Budget](https://leetcode.com/problems/get-equal-substrings-within-budget)

## 题目

You are given two strings `s` and `t` of the same length and an integer
`maxCost`.

You want to change `s` to `t`. Changing the `ith` character of `s` to `ith`
character of `t` costs `|s[i] - t[i]|` (i.e., the absolute difference between
the ASCII values of the characters).

Return _the maximum length of a substring of_`s` _that can be changed to be
the same as the corresponding substring of_`t` _with a cost less than or equal
to_`maxCost`. If there is no substring from `s` that can be changed to its
corresponding substring from `t`, return `0`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "abcd", t = "bcdf", maxCost = 3
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** "abc" of s can change to "bcd".
    That costs 3, so the maximum length is 3.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "abcd", t = "cdef", maxCost = 3
    **Output:** 1
    **Explanation:** Each character in s costs 2 to change to character in t,  so the maximum length is 1.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "abcd", t = "acde", maxCost = 0
    **Output:** 1
    **Explanation:** You cannot make any change, so the maximum length is 1.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `t.length == s.length`
  * `0 <= maxCost <= 106`
  * `s` and `t` consist of only lowercase English letters.
