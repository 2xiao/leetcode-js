# [2000. Reverse Prefix of Word](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-prefix-of-word)

## 题目

Given a **0-indexed** string `word` and a character `ch`, **reverse** the
segment of `word` that starts at index `0` and ends at the index of the
**first occurrence** of `ch` ( **inclusive** ). If the character `ch` does not
exist in `word`, do nothing.

  * For example, if `word = "abcdefd"` and `ch = "d"`, then you should **reverse** the segment that starts at `0` and ends at `3` ( **inclusive** ). The resulting string will be `" _dcba_ efd"`.

Return _the resulting string_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** word = " _abcd_ efd", ch = "d"
    **Output:** " _dcba_ efd"
    **Explanation:**  The first occurrence of "d" is at index 3. 
    Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "dcbaefd".
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** word = " _xyxz_ xe", ch = "z"
    **Output:** " _zxyx_ xe"
    **Explanation:**  The first and only occurrence of "z" is at index 3.
    Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "zxyxxe".
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** word = "abcd", ch = "z"
    **Output:** "abcd"
    **Explanation:**  "z" does not exist in word.
    You should not do any reverse operation, the resulting string is "abcd".
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= word.length <= 250`
  * `word` consists of lowercase English letters.
  * `ch` is a lowercase English letter.
