# [445. Add Two Numbers II](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers-ii/)

## 题目

You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative
integers. The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes
contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked
list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the
number 0 itself.

**Example 1:**

> Input: l1 = [7,2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
>
> Output: [7,8,0,7]

**Example 2:**

> Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
>
> Output: [8,0,7]

**Example 3:**

> Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
>
> Output: [0]

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

**Follow up:** Could you solve it without reversing the input lists?
