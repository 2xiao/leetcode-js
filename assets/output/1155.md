# [1155. Number of Dice Rolls With Target Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-dice-rolls-with-target-sum/)

## 题目

You have `n` dice, and each die has `k` faces numbered from `1` to `k`.

Given three integers `n`, `k`, and `target`, return _the number of possible
ways (out of the_`kn` _total ways)_ _to roll the dice, so the sum of the face-
up numbers equals_`target`. Since the answer may be too large, return it
**modulo** `109 + 7`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 1, k = 6, target = 3
> 
> Output: 1
> 
> Explanation: You throw one die with 6 faces.
> 
> There is only one way to get a sum of 3.

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 2, k = 6, target = 7
> 
> Output: 6
> 
> Explanation: You throw two dice, each with 6 faces.
> 
> There are 6 ways to get a sum of 7: 1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1.

**Example 3:**

> Input: n = 30, k = 30, target = 500
> 
> Output: 222616187
> 
> Explanation: The answer must be returned modulo 109 + 7.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n, k <= 30`
  * `1 <= target <= 1000`
