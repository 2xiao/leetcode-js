# [2220. Minimum Bit Flips to Convert Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-bit-flips-to-convert-number)

## 题目

A **bit flip** of a number `x` is choosing a bit in the binary representation
of `x` and **flipping** it from either `0` to `1` or `1` to `0`.

  * For example, for `x = 7`, the binary representation is `111` and we may choose any bit (including any leading zeros not shown) and flip it. We can flip the first bit from the right to get `110`, flip the second bit from the right to get `101`, flip the fifth bit from the right (a leading zero) to get `10111`, etc.

Given two integers `start` and `goal`, return _the **minimum** number of **bit
flips** to convert _`start` _to_`goal`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** start = 10, goal = 7
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** The binary representation of 10 and 7 are 1010 and 0111 respectively. We can convert 10 to 7 in 3 steps:
    - Flip the first bit from the right: 101 _0_ -> 101 _1_.
    - Flip the third bit from the right: 1 _0_ 11 -> 1 _1_ 11.
    - Flip the fourth bit from the right: _1_ 111 -> _0_ 111.
    It can be shown we cannot convert 10 to 7 in less than 3 steps. Hence, we return 3.

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** start = 3, goal = 4
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** The binary representation of 3 and 4 are 011 and 100 respectively. We can convert 3 to 4 in 3 steps:
    - Flip the first bit from the right: 01 _1_ -> 01 _0_.
    - Flip the second bit from the right: 0 _1_ 0 -> 0 _0_ 0.
    - Flip the third bit from the right: _0_ 00 -> _1_ 00.
    It can be shown we cannot convert 3 to 4 in less than 3 steps. Hence, we return 3.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= start, goal <= 109`
