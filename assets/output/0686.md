# [686. Repeated String Match](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-string-match/)

## 题目

Given two strings `a` and `b`, return _the minimum number of times you should
repeat string_`a` _so that string_ `b` _is a substring of it_. If it is
impossible for `b`​​​​​​ to be a substring of `a` after repeating it, return
`-1`.

**Notice:** string `"abc"` repeated 0 times is `""`, repeated 1 time is
`"abc"` and repeated 2 times is `"abcabc"`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: a = "abcd", b = "cdabcdab"
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: We return 3 because by repeating a three times "ab **cdabcdab** cd", b is a substring of it.

**Example 2:**

> Input: a = "a", b = "aa"
>
> Output: 2

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10^4`
- `a` and `b` consist of lowercase English letters.
