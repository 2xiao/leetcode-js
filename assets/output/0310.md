# [310. Minimum Height Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees)

## 题目

A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by
_exactly_  one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles
is a tree.

Given a tree of `n` nodes labelled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array of `n -
1` `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an undirected
edge between the two nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree, you can choose any node
of the tree as the root. When you select a node `x` as the root, the result
tree has height `h`. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum
height (i.e. `min(h)`)  are called **minimum height trees** (MHTs).

Return _a list of all **MHTs '** root labels_. You can return the answer in
**any order**.

The **height** of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward
path between the root and a leaf.



**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 4, edges = [[1,0],[1,2],[1,3]]
> 
> Output: [1]
> 
> Explanation: As shown, the height of the tree is 1 when the root is the node with label 1 which is the only MHT.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/01/e2.jpg)

> Input: n = 6, edges = [[3,0],[3,1],[3,2],[3,4],[5,4]]
> 
> Output: [3,4]

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
  * `edges.length == n - 1`
  * `0 <= ai, bi < n`
  * `ai != bi`
  * All the pairs `(ai, bi)` are distinct.
  * The given input is **guaranteed** to be a tree and there will be **no repeated** edges.
