# [274. H-Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index)

## 题目

Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of
citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper, return _the researcher
's h-index_.

According to the [definition of h-index on
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): The h-index is defined as
the maximum value of `h` such that the given researcher has published at least
`h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
    Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** citations = [1,3,1]
    **Output:** 1
    



**Constraints:**

  * `n == citations.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 5000`
  * `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`
