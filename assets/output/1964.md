# [1964. Find the Longest Valid Obstacle Course at Each Position](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-longest-valid-obstacle-course-at-each-position)

## 题目

You want to build some obstacle courses. You are given a **0-indexed** integer
array `obstacles` of length `n`, where `obstacles[i]` describes the height of
the `ith` obstacle.

For every index `i` between `0` and `n - 1` ( **inclusive** ), find the length
of the **longest obstacle course** in `obstacles` such that:

  * You choose any number of obstacles between `0` and `i` **inclusive**.
  * You must include the `ith` obstacle in the course.
  * You must put the chosen obstacles in the **same order** as they appear in `obstacles`.
  * Every obstacle (except the first) is **taller** than or the **same height** as the obstacle immediately before it.

Return _an array_ `ans` _of length_ `n`, _where_ `ans[i]` _is the length of
the **longest obstacle course** for index_ `i` _as described above_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** obstacles = [1,2,3,2]
    **Output:** [1,2,3,3]
    **Explanation:** The longest valid obstacle course at each position is:
    - i = 0: [ _1_ ], [1] has length 1.
    - i = 1: [ _1_ , _2_ ], [1,2] has length 2.
    - i = 2: [ _1_ , _2_ , _3_ ], [1,2,3] has length 3.
    - i = 3: [ _1_ , _2_ ,3, _2_ ], [1,2,2] has length 3.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** obstacles = [2,2,1]
    **Output:** [1,2,1]
    **Explanation:** The longest valid obstacle course at each position is:
    - i = 0: [ _2_ ], [2] has length 1.
    - i = 1: [ _2_ , _2_ ], [2,2] has length 2.
    - i = 2: [2,2, _1_ ], [1] has length 1.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** obstacles = [3,1,5,6,4,2]
    **Output:** [1,1,2,3,2,2]
    **Explanation:** The longest valid obstacle course at each position is:
    - i = 0: [ _3_ ], [3] has length 1.
    - i = 1: [3, _1_ ], [1] has length 1.
    - i = 2: [ _3_ ,1, _5_ ], [3,5] has length 2. [1,5] is also valid.
    - i = 3: [ _3_ ,1, _5_ , _6_ ], [3,5,6] has length 3. [1,5,6] is also valid.
    - i = 4: [ _3_ ,1,5,6, _4_ ], [3,4] has length 2. [1,4] is also valid.
    - i = 5: [3, _1_ ,5,6,4, _2_ ], [1,2] has length 2.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `n == obstacles.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 105`
  * `1 <= obstacles[i] <= 107`
