# [3102. Minimize Manhattan Distances](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-manhattan-distances/)

## 题目

You are given an array `points` representing integer coordinates of some
points on a 2D plane, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`.

The distance between two points is defined as their Manhattan distance.

Return _the**minimum** possible value for **maximum** distance between any two
points by removing exactly one point_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** points = [[3,10],[5,15],[10,2],[4,4]]

**Output:** 12

**Explanation:**

The maximum distance after removing each point is the following:

- After removing the 0th point the maximum distance is between points (5, 15) and (10, 2), which is `|5 - 10| + |15 - 2| = 18`.
- After removing the 1st point the maximum distance is between points (3, 10) and (10, 2), which is `|3 - 10| + |10 - 2| = 15`.
- After removing the 2nd point the maximum distance is between points (5, 15) and (4, 4), which is `|5 - 4| + |15 - 4| = 12`.
- After removing the 3rd point the maximum distance is between points (5, 15) and (10, 2), which is `|5 - 10| + |15 - 2| = 18`.

12 is the minimum possible maximum distance between any two points after
removing exactly one point.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** points = [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

Removing any of the points results in the maximum distance between any two
points of 0.

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= points.length <= 10^5`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 10^8`
