# [275. H-Index II](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index-ii/)

## 题目

Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of
citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper and `citations` is
sorted in **ascending order** , return _the researcher 's h-index_.

According to the [definition of h-index on
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): The h-index is defined as
the maximum value of `h` such that the given researcher has published at least
`h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times.

You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.

**Example 1:**

> Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
>
> Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

**Example 2:**

> Input: citations = [1,2,100]
>
> Output: 2

**Constraints:**

- `n == citations.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`
- `citations` is sorted in **ascending order**.
