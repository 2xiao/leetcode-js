# [696. Count Binary Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-binary-substrings/)

## 题目

Given a binary string `s`, return the number of non-empty substrings that have
the same number of `0`'s and `1`'s, and all the `0`'s and all the `1`'s in
these substrings are grouped consecutively.

Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they
occur.



**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "00110011"
> 
> Output: 6
> 
> Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".
> 
> Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.
> 
> Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "10101"
> 
> Output: 4
> 
> Explanation: There are 4 substrings: "10", "01", "10", "01" that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
