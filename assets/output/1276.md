# [1276. Number of Burgers with No Waste of Ingredients](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-burgers-with-no-waste-of-ingredients)

## 题目

Given two integers `tomatoSlices` and `cheeseSlices`. The ingredients of
different burgers are as follows:

  * **Jumbo Burger:** `4` tomato slices and `1` cheese slice.
  * **Small Burger:** `2` Tomato slices and `1` cheese slice.

Return `[total_jumbo, total_small]` so that the number of remaining
`tomatoSlices` equal to `0` and the number of remaining `cheeseSlices` equal
to `0`. If it is not possible to make the remaining `tomatoSlices` and
`cheeseSlices` equal to `0` return `[]`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** tomatoSlices = 16, cheeseSlices = 7
    **Output:** [1,6]
    **Explantion:** To make one jumbo burger and 6 small burgers we need 4*1 + 2*6 = 16 tomato and 1 + 6 = 7 cheese.
    There will be no remaining ingredients.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** tomatoSlices = 17, cheeseSlices = 4
    **Output:** []
    **Explantion:** There will be no way to use all ingredients to make small and jumbo burgers.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** tomatoSlices = 4, cheeseSlices = 17
    **Output:** []
    **Explantion:** Making 1 jumbo burger there will be 16 cheese remaining and making 2 small burgers there will be 15 cheese remaining.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= tomatoSlices, cheeseSlices <= 107`
