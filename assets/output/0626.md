Write a solution to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the
number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.

Return the result table ordered by `id` **in ascending order**.

The result format is in the following example.



**Example 1:**

> Input: 
> 
> Seat table:
> 
> +----+---------+
> 
> | id | student |
> 
> +----+---------+
> 
> | 1  | Abbot   |
> 
> | 2  | Doris   |
> 
> | 3  | Emerson |
> 
> | 4  | Green   |
> 
> | 5  | Jeames  |
> 
> +----+---------+
> 
> Output: 
> 
> +----+---------+
> 
> | id | student |
> 
> +----+---------+
> 
> | 1  | Doris   |
> 
> | 2  | Abbot   |
> 
> | 3  | Green   |
> 
> | 4  | Emerson |
> 
> | 5  | Jeames  |
> 
> +----+---------+
