# [2193. Minimum Number of Moves to Make Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-moves-to-make-palindrome)

## 题目

You are given a string `s` consisting only of lowercase English letters.

In one **move** , you can select any two **adjacent** characters of `s` and
swap them.

Return _the **minimum number of moves** needed to make_ `s` _a palindrome_.

**Note** that the input will be generated such that `s` can always be
converted to a palindrome.



**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "aabb"
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> We can obtain two palindromes from s, "abba" and "baab". 
> - We can obtain "abba" from s in 2 moves: "a _ **ab**_ b" -> "ab _ **ab**_ " -> "abba".
> - We can obtain "baab" from s in 2 moves: "a _ **ab**_ b" -> " _ **ab**_ ab" -> "baab".
> 
> Thus, the minimum number of moves needed to make s a palindrome is 2.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "letelt"
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> One of the palindromes we can obtain from s in 2 moves is "lettel".
> 
> One of the ways we can obtain it is "lete _ **lt**_ " -> "let _ **et**_ l" -> "lettel".
> 
> Other palindromes such as "tleelt" can also be obtained in 2 moves.
> 
> It can be shown that it is not possible to obtain a palindrome in less than 2 moves.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 2000`
  * `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
  * `s` can be converted to a palindrome using a finite number of moves.
