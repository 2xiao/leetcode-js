# [1453. Maximum Number of Darts Inside of a Circular Dartboard](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-darts-inside-of-a-circular-dartboard)

## 题目

Alice is throwing `n` darts on a very large wall. You are given an array
`darts` where `darts[i] = [xi, yi]` is the position of the `ith` dart that
Alice threw on the wall.

Bob knows the positions of the `n` darts on the wall. He wants to place a
dartboard of radius `r` on the wall so that the maximum number of darts that
Alice throws lie on the dartboard.

Given the integer `r`, return _the maximum number of darts that can lie on the
dartboard_.



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** darts = [[-2,0],[2,0],[0,2],[0,-2]], r = 2
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** Circle dartboard with center in (0,0) and radius = 2 contain all points.
    

**Example 2:**

    **Input:** darts = [[-3,0],[3,0],[2,6],[5,4],[0,9],[7,8]], r = 5
    **Output:** 5
    **Explanation:** Circle dartboard with center in (0,4) and radius = 5 contain all points except the point (7,8).
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= darts.length <= 100`
  * `darts[i].length == 2`
  * `-104 <= xi, yi <= 104`
  * All the `darts` are unique
  * `1 <= r <= 5000`
