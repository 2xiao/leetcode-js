# [2246. Longest Path With Different Adjacent Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-path-with-different-adjacent-characters)

## 题目

You are given a **tree** (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no
cycles) **rooted** at node `0` consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n
- 1`. The tree is represented by a **0-indexed** array `parent` of size `n`,
where `parent[i]` is the parent of node `i`. Since node `0` is the root,
`parent[0] == -1`.

You are also given a string `s` of length `n`, where `s[i]` is the character
assigned to node `i`.

Return _the length of the **longest path** in the tree such that no pair of
**adjacent** nodes on the path have the same character assigned to them._



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/25/testingdrawio.png)

> Input: parent = [-1,0,0,1,1,2], s = "abacbe"
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation: The longest path where each two adjacent nodes have different characters in the tree is the path: 0 -> 1 -> 3. The length of this path is 3, so 3 is returned.
> 
> It can be proven that there is no longer path that satisfies the conditions. 

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/25/graph2drawio.png)

> Input: parent = [-1,0,0,0], s = "aabc"
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation: The longest path where each two adjacent nodes have different characters is the path: 2 -> 0 -> 3. The length of this path is 3, so 3 is returned.

**Constraints:**

  * `n == parent.length == s.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 105`
  * `0 <= parent[i] <= n - 1` for all `i >= 1`
  * `parent[0] == -1`
  * `parent` represents a valid tree.
  * `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
