# [1869. Longer Contiguous Segments of Ones than Zeros](https://leetcode.com/problems/longer-contiguous-segments-of-ones-than-zeros)

## 题目

Given a binary string `s`, return `true` _if the **longest** contiguous
segment of _`1`' _s is **strictly longer** than the **longest** contiguous
segment of _`0`' _s in_`s`, or return `false` _otherwise_.

  * For example, in `s = " _11_ 01 _000_ 10"` the longest continuous segment of `1`s has length `2`, and the longest continuous segment of `0`s has length `3`.

Note that if there are no `0`'s, then the longest continuous segment of `0`'s
is considered to have a length `0`. The same applies if there is no `1`'s.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "1101"
    **Output:** true
    **Explanation:**
    The longest contiguous segment of 1s has length 2: " _11_ 01"
    The longest contiguous segment of 0s has length 1: "11 _0_ 1"
    The segment of 1s is longer, so return true.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "111000"
    **Output:** false
    **Explanation:**
    The longest contiguous segment of 1s has length 3: " _111_ 000"
    The longest contiguous segment of 0s has length 3: "111 _000_ "
    The segment of 1s is not longer, so return false.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "110100010"
    **Output:** false
    **Explanation:**
    The longest contiguous segment of 1s has length 2: " _11_ 0100010"
    The longest contiguous segment of 0s has length 3: "1101 _000_ 10"
    The segment of 1s is not longer, so return false.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 100`
  * `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
