# [689. Maximum Sum of 3 Non-Overlapping Subarrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-of-3-non-overlapping-subarrays)

## 题目

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, find three non-overlapping
subarrays of length `k` with maximum sum and return them.

Return the result as a list of indices representing the starting position of
each interval ( **0-indexed** ). If there are multiple answers, return the
lexicographically smallest one.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [1,2,1,2,6,7,5,1], k = 2
    **Output:** [0,3,5]
    **Explanation:** Subarrays [1, 2], [2, 6], [7, 5] correspond to the starting indices [0, 3, 5].
    We could have also taken [2, 1], but an answer of [1, 3, 5] would be lexicographically larger.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1], k = 2
    **Output:** [0,2,4]
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104`
  * `1 <= nums[i] < 216`
  * `1 <= k <= floor(nums.length / 3)`
