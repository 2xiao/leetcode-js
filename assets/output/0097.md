# [97. Interleaving String](https://leetcode.com/problems/interleaving-string)

## 题目

Given strings `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`, find whether `s3` is formed by an
**interleaving** of `s1` and `s2`.

An **interleaving** of two strings `s` and `t` is a configuration where `s`
and `t` are divided into `n` and `m` substrings respectively, such that:

  * `s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn`
  * `t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm`
  * `|n - m| <= 1`
  * The **interleaving** is `s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ...` or `t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...`

**Note:** `a + b` is the concatenation of strings `a` and `b`.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/02/interleave.jpg)

    
    
    **Input:** s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbcbcac"
    **Output:** true
    **Explanation:** One way to obtain s3 is:
    Split s1 into s1 = "aa" + "bc" + "c", and s2 into s2 = "dbbc" + "a".
    Interleaving the two splits, we get "aa" + "dbbc" + "bc" + "a" + "c" = "aadbbcbcac".
    Since s3 can be obtained by interleaving s1 and s2, we return true.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbbaccc"
    **Output:** false
    **Explanation:** Notice how it is impossible to interleave s2 with any other string to obtain s3.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** s1 = "", s2 = "", s3 = ""
    **Output:** true
    



**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100`
  * `0 <= s3.length <= 200`
  * `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` consist of lowercase English letters.



**Follow up:** Could you solve it using only `O(s2.length)` additional memory
space?
