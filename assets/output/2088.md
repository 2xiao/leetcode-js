# [2088. Count Fertile Pyramids in a Land](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-fertile-pyramids-in-a-land)

## 题目

A farmer has a **rectangular grid** of land with `m` rows and `n` columns that
can be divided into unit cells. Each cell is either **fertile** (represented
by a `1`) or **barren** (represented by a `0`). All cells outside the grid are
considered barren.

A **pyramidal plot** of land can be defined as a set of cells with the
following criteria:

  1. The number of cells in the set has to be **greater than**`1` and all cells must be **fertile**.
  2. The **apex** of a pyramid is the **topmost** cell of the pyramid. The **height** of a pyramid is the number of rows it covers. Let `(r, c)` be the apex of the pyramid, and its height be `h`. Then, the plot comprises of cells `(i, j)` where `r <= i <= r + h - 1` **and** `c - (i - r) <= j <= c + (i - r)`.

An **inverse pyramidal plot** of land can be defined as a set of cells with
similar criteria:

  1. The number of cells in the set has to be **greater than**`1` and all cells must be **fertile**.
  2. The **apex** of an inverse pyramid is the **bottommost** cell of the inverse pyramid. The **height** of an inverse pyramid is the number of rows it covers. Let `(r, c)` be the apex of the pyramid, and its height be `h`. Then, the plot comprises of cells `(i, j)` where `r - h + 1 <= i <= r` **and** `c - (r - i) <= j <= c + (r - i)`.

Some examples of valid and invalid pyramidal (and inverse pyramidal) plots are
shown below. Black cells indicate fertile cells.

Given a **0-indexed** `m x n` binary matrix `grid` representing the farmland,
return _the **total number** of pyramidal and inverse pyramidal plots that can
be found in_ `grid`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: grid = [[0,1,1,0],[1,1,1,1]]
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: The 2 possible pyramidal plots are shown in blue and red respectively.
> 
> There are no inverse pyramidal plots in this grid. 
> 
> Hence total number of pyramidal and inverse pyramidal plots is 2 + 0 = 2.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/22/2.JPG)

> Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: The pyramidal plot is shown in blue, and the inverse pyramidal plot is shown in red. 
> 
> Hence the total number of plots is 1 + 1 = 2.

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/22/3.JPG)

> Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,0],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[0,1,0,0,1]]
> 
> Output: 13
> 
> Explanation: There are 7 pyramidal plots, 3 of which are shown in the 2nd and 3rd figures.
> 
> There are 6 inverse pyramidal plots, 2 of which are shown in the last figure.
> 
> The total number of plots is 7 + 6 = 13.

**Constraints:**

  * `m == grid.length`
  * `n == grid[i].length`
  * `1 <= m, n <= 1000`
  * `1 <= m * n <= 105`
  * `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
