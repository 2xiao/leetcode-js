# [2466. Count Ways To Build Good Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-ways-to-build-good-strings/)

## 题目

Given the integers `zero`, `one`, `low`, and `high`, we can construct a string
by starting with an empty string, and then at each step perform either of the
following:

  * Append the character `'0'` `zero` times.
  * Append the character `'1'` `one` times.

This can be performed any number of times.

A **good** string is a string constructed by the above process having a
**length** between `low` and `high` ( **inclusive** ).

Return _the number of **different** good strings that can be constructed
satisfying these properties._ Since the answer can be large, return it
**modulo** `109 + 7`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: low = 3, high = 3, zero = 1, one = 1
> 
> Output: 8
> 
> Explanation: 
> 
> One possible valid good string is "011". 
> 
> It can be constructed as follows: "" -> "0" -> "01" -> "011". 
> 
> All binary strings from "000" to "111" are good strings in this example.

**Example 2:**

> Input: low = 2, high = 3, zero = 1, one = 2
> 
> Output: 5
> 
> Explanation: The good strings are "00", "11", "000", "110", and "011".

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= low <= high <= 105`
  * `1 <= zero, one <= low`
