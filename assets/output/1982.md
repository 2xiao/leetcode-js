# [1982. Find Array Given Subset Sums](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-array-given-subset-sums)

## 题目

You are given an integer `n` representing the length of an unknown array that
you are trying to recover. You are also given an array `sums` containing the
values of all `2n` **subset sums** of the unknown array (in no particular
order).

Return _the array_`ans` _of length_`n` _representing the unknown array. If
**multiple** answers exist, return **any** of them_.

An array `sub` is a **subset** of an array `arr` if `sub` can be obtained from
`arr` by deleting some (possibly zero or all) elements of `arr`. The sum of
the elements in `sub` is one possible **subset sum** of `arr`. The sum of an
empty array is considered to be `0`.

**Note:** Test cases are generated such that there will **always** be at least
one correct answer.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 3, sums = [-3,-2,-1,0,0,1,2,3]
    **Output:** [1,2,-3]
    **Explanation:** [1,2,-3] is able to achieve the given subset sums:
    - []: sum is 0
    - [1]: sum is 1
    - [2]: sum is 2
    - [1,2]: sum is 3
    - [-3]: sum is -3
    - [1,-3]: sum is -2
    - [2,-3]: sum is -1
    - [1,2,-3]: sum is 0
    Note that any permutation of [1,2,-3] and also any permutation of [-1,-2,3] will also be accepted.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 2, sums = [0,0,0,0]
    **Output:** [0,0]
    **Explanation:** The only correct answer is [0,0].
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 4, sums = [0,0,5,5,4,-1,4,9,9,-1,4,3,4,8,3,8]
    **Output:** [0,-1,4,5]
    **Explanation:** [0,-1,4,5] is able to achieve the given subset sums.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 15`
  * `sums.length == 2n`
  * `-104 <= sums[i] <= 104`
