# [3152. Special Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/special-array-ii/)

## 题目

An array is considered **special** if every pair of its adjacent elements
contains two numbers with different parity.

You are given an array of integer `nums` and a 2D integer matrix `queries`,
where for `queries[i] = [fromi, toi]` your task is to check that subarray
`nums[fromi..toi]` is **special** or not.

Return an array of booleans `answer` such that `answer[i]` is `true` if
`nums[fromi..toi]` is special.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [3,4,1,2,6], queries = [[0,4]]

**Output:** [false]

**Explanation:**

The subarray is `[3,4,1,2,6]`. 2 and 6 are both even.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [4,3,1,6], queries = [[0,2],[2,3]]

**Output:** [false,true]

**Explanation:**

1. The subarray is `[4,3,1]`. 3 and 1 are both odd. So the answer to this query is `false`.
2. The subarray is `[1,6]`. There is only one pair: `(1,6)` and it contains numbers with different parity. So the answer to this query is `true`.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`
- `queries[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= queries[i][0] <= queries[i][1] <= nums.length - 1`
