# [1944. Number of Visible People in a Queue](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-visible-people-in-a-queue)

## 题目

There are `n` people standing in a queue, and they numbered from `0` to `n -
1` in **left to right** order. You are given an array `heights` of
**distinct** integers where `heights[i]` represents the height of the `ith`
person.

A person can **see** another person to their right in the queue if everybody
in between is **shorter** than both of them. More formally, the `ith` person
can see the `jth` person if `i < j` and `min(heights[i], heights[j]) >
max(heights[i+1], heights[i+2], ..., heights[j-1])`.

Return _an array_`answer` _of length_`n` _where_`answer[i]` _is the **number
of people** the _`ith` _person can **see** to their right in the queue_.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/29/queue-plane.jpg)

    
    
    **Input:** heights = [10,6,8,5,11,9]
    **Output:** [3,1,2,1,1,0]
    **Explanation:**
    Person 0 can see person 1, 2, and 4.
    Person 1 can see person 2.
    Person 2 can see person 3 and 4.
    Person 3 can see person 4.
    Person 4 can see person 5.
    Person 5 can see no one since nobody is to the right of them.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** heights = [5,1,2,3,10]
    **Output:** [4,1,1,1,0]
    



**Constraints:**

  * `n == heights.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 105`
  * `1 <= heights[i] <= 105`
  * All the values of `heights` are **unique**.
