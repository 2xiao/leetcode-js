# [2902. Count of Sub-Multisets With Bounded Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-sub-multisets-with-bounded-sum)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` of non-negative integers, and two
integers `l` and `r`.

Return _the **count of sub-multisets** within_ `nums` _where the sum of
elements in each subset falls within the inclusive range of_ `[l, r]`.

Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.

A **sub-multiset** is an **unordered** collection of elements of the array in
which a given value `x` can occur `0, 1, ..., occ[x]` times, where `occ[x]` is
the number of occurrences of `x` in the array.

**Note** that:

  * Two **sub-multisets** are the same if sorting both sub-multisets results in identical multisets.
  * The sum of an **empty** multiset is `0`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [1,2,2,3], l = 6, r = 6
    **Output:** 1
    **Explanation:** The only subset of nums that has a sum of 6 is {1, 2, 3}.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [2,1,4,2,7], l = 1, r = 5
    **Output:** 7
    **Explanation:** The subsets of nums that have a sum within the range [1, 5] are {1}, {2}, {4}, {2, 2}, {1, 2}, {1, 4}, and {1, 2, 2}.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [1,2,1,3,5,2], l = 3, r = 5
    **Output:** 9
    **Explanation:** The subsets of nums that have a sum within the range [3, 5] are {3}, {5}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 2}, {2, 3}, {1, 1, 2}, {1, 1, 3}, and {1, 2, 2}.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104`
  * `0 <= nums[i] <= 2 * 104`
  * Sum of `nums` does not exceed `2 * 104`.
  * `0 <= l <= r <= 2 * 104`
