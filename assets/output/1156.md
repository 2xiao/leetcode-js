# [1156. Swap For Longest Repeated Character Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-for-longest-repeated-character-substring/)

## 题目

You are given a string `text`. You can swap two of the characters in the
`text`.

Return _the length of the longest substring with repeated characters_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: text = "ababa"
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: We can swap the first 'b' with the last 'a', or the last 'b' with the first 'a'. Then, the longest repeated character substring is "aaa" with length 3.

**Example 2:**

> Input: text = "aaabaaa"
>
> Output: 6
>
> Explanation: Swap 'b' with the last 'a' (or the first 'a'), and we get longest repeated character substring "aaaaaa" with length 6.

**Example 3:**

> Input: text = "aaaaa"
>
> Output: 5
>
> Explanation: No need to swap, longest repeated character substring is "aaaaa" with length is 5.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= text.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `text` consist of lowercase English characters only.
