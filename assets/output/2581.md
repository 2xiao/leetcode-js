# [2581. Count Number of Possible Root Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-possible-root-nodes)

## 题目

Alice has an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. The
tree is represented as a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1` where
`edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and
`bi` in the tree.

Alice wants Bob to find the root of the tree. She allows Bob to make several
**guesses** about her tree. In one guess, he does the following:

  * Chooses two **distinct** integers `u` and `v` such that there exists an edge `[u, v]` in the tree.
  * He tells Alice that `u` is the **parent** of `v` in the tree.

Bob's guesses are represented by a 2D integer array `guesses` where
`guesses[j] = [uj, vj]` indicates Bob guessed `uj` to be the parent of `vj`.

Alice being lazy, does not reply to each of Bob's guesses, but just says that
**at least** `k` of his guesses are `true`.

Given the 2D integer arrays `edges`, `guesses` and the integer `k`, return
_the **number of possible nodes** that can be the root of Alice's tree_. If
there is no such tree, return `0`.



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[4,2]], guesses = [[1,3],[0,1],[1,0],[2,4]], k = 3
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** 
    Root = 0, correct guesses = [1,3], [0,1], [2,4]
    Root = 1, correct guesses = [1,3], [1,0], [2,4]
    Root = 2, correct guesses = [1,3], [1,0], [2,4]
    Root = 3, correct guesses = [1,0], [2,4]
    Root = 4, correct guesses = [1,3], [1,0]
    Considering 0, 1, or 2 as root node leads to 3 correct guesses.
    
    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/12/19/ex-2.png)

    
    
    **Input:** edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]], guesses = [[1,0],[3,4],[2,1],[3,2]], k = 1
    **Output:** 5
    **Explanation:** 
    Root = 0, correct guesses = [3,4]
    Root = 1, correct guesses = [1,0], [3,4]
    Root = 2, correct guesses = [1,0], [2,1], [3,4]
    Root = 3, correct guesses = [1,0], [2,1], [3,2], [3,4]
    Root = 4, correct guesses = [1,0], [2,1], [3,2]
    Considering any node as root will give at least 1 correct guess. 
    
    



**Constraints:**

  * `edges.length == n - 1`
  * `2 <= n <= 105`
  * `1 <= guesses.length <= 105`
  * `0 <= ai, bi, uj, vj <= n - 1`
  * `ai != bi`
  * `uj != vj`
  * `edges` represents a valid tree.
  * `guesses[j]` is an edge of the tree.
  * `guesses` is unique.
  * `0 <= k <= guesses.length`
