# [2014. Longest Subsequence Repeated k Times](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subsequence-repeated-k-times/)

## 题目

You are given a string `s` of length `n`, and an integer `k`. You are tasked
to find the **longest subsequence repeated** `k` times in string `s`.

A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by
deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining
characters.

A subsequence `seq` is **repeated** `k` times in the string `s` if `seq * k`
is a subsequence of `s`, where `seq * k` represents a string constructed by
concatenating `seq` `k` times.

  * For example, `"bba"` is repeated `2` times in the string `"bababcba"`, because the string `"bbabba"`, constructed by concatenating `"bba"` `2` times, is a subsequence of the string `" ** _b_** a ** _bab_** c ** _ba_** "`.

Return _the **longest subsequence repeated** _`k` _times in string_`s` _. If
multiple such subsequences are found, return the **lexicographically largest**
one. If there is no such subsequence, return an **empty** string_.



**Example 1:**

subsequence-repeat-k-times.png)

> Input: s = "letsleetcode", k = 2
> 
> Output: "let"
> 
> Explanation: There are two longest subsequences repeated 2 times: "let" and "ete".
> 
> "let" is the lexicographically largest one.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "bb", k = 2
> 
> Output: "b"
> 
> Explanation: The longest subsequence repeated 2 times is "b".

**Example 3:**

> Input: s = "ab", k = 2
> 
> Output: ""
> 
> Explanation: There is no subsequence repeated 2 times. Empty string is returned.

**Constraints:**

  * `n == s.length`
  * `2 <= n, k <= 2000`
  * `2 <= n < k * 8`
  * `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
