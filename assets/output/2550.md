# [2550. Count Collisions of Monkeys on a Polygon](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-collisions-of-monkeys-on-a-polygon/)

## 题目

There is a regular convex polygon with `n` vertices. The vertices are labeled
from `0` to `n - 1` in a clockwise direction, and each vertex has **exactly
one monkey**. The following figure shows a convex polygon of `6` vertices.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/01/22/hexagon.jpg)

Each monkey moves simultaneously to a neighboring vertex. A neighboring vertex
for a vertex `i` can be:

- the vertex `(i + 1) % n` in the clockwise direction, or
- the vertex `(i - 1 + n) % n` in the counter-clockwise direction.

A **collision** happens if at least two monkeys reside on the same vertex
after the movement or intersect on an edge.

Return _the number of ways the monkeys can move so that at least **one
collision**_ _happens_. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo
`10^9 + 7`.

**Note** that each monkey can only move once.

**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 3
>
> Output: 6
>
> Explanation: There are 8 total possible movements.
>
> Two ways such that they collide at some point are:
>
> - Monkey 1 moves in a clockwise direction; monkey 2 moves in an anticlockwise direction; monkey 3 moves in a clockwise direction. Monkeys 1 and 2 collide.
> - Monkey 1 moves in an anticlockwise direction; monkey 2 moves in an anticlockwise direction; monkey 3 moves in a clockwise direction. Monkeys 1 and 3 collide.
>
> It can be shown 6 total movements result in a collision.

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 4
>
> Output: 14
>
> Explanation: It can be shown that there are 14 ways for the monkeys to collide.

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= n <= 10^9`
