# [3086. Minimum Moves to Pick K Ones](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-pick-k-ones/)

## 题目

You are given a binary array `nums` of length `n`, a **positive** integer `k`
and a **non-negative** integer `maxChanges`.

Alice plays a game, where the goal is for Alice to pick up `k` ones from
`nums` using the **minimum** number of **moves**. When the game starts, Alice
picks up any index `aliceIndex` in the range `[0, n - 1]` and stands there. If
`nums[aliceIndex] == 1` , Alice picks up the one and `nums[aliceIndex]`
becomes `0`(this **does not** count as a move). After this, Alice can make
**any** number of **moves** (**including** **zero**) where in each move Alice
must perform **exactly** one of the following actions:

- Select any index `j != aliceIndex` such that `nums[j] == 0` and set `nums[j] = 1`. This action can be performed **at** **most** `maxChanges` times.
- Select any two adjacent indices `x` and `y` (`|x - y| == 1`) such that `nums[x] == 1`, `nums[y] == 0`, then swap their values (set `nums[y] = 1` and `nums[x] = 0`). If `y == aliceIndex`, Alice picks up the one after this move and `nums[y]` becomes `0`.

Return _the**minimum** number of moves required by Alice to pick
**exactly**_`k` _ones_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1], k = 3, maxChanges = 1

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** Alice can pick up `3` ones in `3` moves, if Alice performs
the following actions in each move when standing at `aliceIndex == 1`:

- At the start of the game Alice picks up the one and `nums[1]` becomes `0`. `nums` becomes `[1,**_0_** ,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1]`.
- Select `j == 2` and perform an action of the first type. `nums` becomes `[1,**_0_** ,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1]`
- Select `x == 2` and `y == 1`, and perform an action of the second type. `nums` becomes `[1,**_1_** ,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1]`. As `y == aliceIndex`, Alice picks up the one and `nums` becomes `[1,**_0_** ,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1]`.
- Select `x == 0` and `y == 1`, and perform an action of the second type. `nums` becomes `[0,**_1_** ,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1]`. As `y == aliceIndex`, Alice picks up the one and `nums` becomes `[0,**_0_** ,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1]`.

Note that it may be possible for Alice to pick up `3` ones using some other
sequence of `3` moves.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [0,0,0,0], k = 2, maxChanges = 3

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** Alice can pick up `2` ones in `4` moves, if Alice performs
the following actions in each move when standing at `aliceIndex == 0`:

- Select `j == 1` and perform an action of the first type. `nums` becomes `[**_0_** ,1,0,0]`.
- Select `x == 1` and `y == 0`, and perform an action of the second type. `nums` becomes `[**_1_** ,0,0,0]`. As `y == aliceIndex`, Alice picks up the one and `nums` becomes `[**_0_** ,0,0,0]`.
- Select `j == 1` again and perform an action of the first type. `nums` becomes `[**_0_** ,1,0,0]`.
- Select `x == 1` and `y == 0` again, and perform an action of the second type. `nums` becomes `[**_1_** ,0,0,0]`. As `y == aliceIndex`, Alice picks up the one and `nums` becomes `[**_0_** ,0,0,0]`.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1`
- `1 <= k <= 10^5`
- `0 <= maxChanges <= 10^5`
- `maxChanges + sum(nums) >= k`
