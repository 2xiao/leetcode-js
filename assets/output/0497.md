# [497. Random Point in Non-overlapping Rectangles](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-point-in-non-overlapping-rectangles/)

## 题目

You are given an array of non-overlapping axis-aligned rectangles `rects`
where `rects[i] = [ai, bi, xi, yi]` indicates that `(ai, bi)` is the bottom-
left corner point of the `ith` rectangle and `(xi, yi)` is the top-right
corner point of the `ith` rectangle. Design an algorithm to pick a random
integer point inside the space covered by one of the given rectangles. A point
on the perimeter of a rectangle is included in the space covered by the
rectangle.

Any integer point inside the space covered by one of the given rectangles
should be equally likely to be returned.

**Note** that an integer point is a point that has integer coordinates.

Implement the `Solution` class:

- `Solution(int[][] rects)` Initializes the object with the given rectangles `rects`.
- `int[] pick()` Returns a random integer point `[u, v]` inside the space covered by one of the given rectangles.

**Example 1:**

> **Input**
>
> ["Solution", "pick", "pick", "pick", "pick", "pick"]
>
> [[[[-2, -2, 1, 1], [2, 2, 4, 6]]], [], [], [], [], []]
>
> **Output**
>
> [null, [1, -2], [1, -1], [-1, -2], [-2, -2], [0, 0]]
>
> **Explanation**
>
> Solution solution = new Solution([[-2, -2, 1, 1], [2, 2, 4, 6]]);
>
> solution.pick(); // return [1, -2]
>
> solution.pick(); // return [1, -1]
>
> solution.pick(); // return [-1, -2]
>
> solution.pick(); // return [-2, -2]
>
> solution.pick(); // return [0, 0]

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= rects.length <= 100`
- `rects[i].length == 4`
- `-10^9 <= ai < xi <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= bi < yi <= 10^9`
- `xi - ai <= 2000`
- `yi - bi <= 2000`
- All the rectangles do not overlap.
- At most `10^4` calls will be made to `pick`.
