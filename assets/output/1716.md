# [1716. Calculate Money in Leetcode Bank](https://leetcode.com/problems/calculate-money-in-leetcode-bank/)

## 题目

Hercy wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the Leetcode
bank **every day**.

He starts by putting in `$1` on Monday, the first day. Every day from Tuesday
to Sunday, he will put in `$1` more than the day before. On every subsequent
Monday, he will put in `$1` more than the **previous Monday**.

Given `n`, return _the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank
at the end of the_`nth` _day._



**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 4
> 
> Output: 10
> 
> Explanation:  After the 4th day, the total is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 10
> 
> Output: 37
> 
> Explanation:  After the 10th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4) = 37. Notice that on the 2nd Monday, Hercy only puts in $2.

**Example 3:**

> Input: n = 20
> 
> Output: 96
> 
> Explanation:  After the 20th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) + (3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) = 96.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 1000`
