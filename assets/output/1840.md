# [1840. Maximum Building Height](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-building-height/)

## 题目

You want to build `n` new buildings in a city. The new buildings will be built
in a line and are labeled from `1` to `n`.

However, there are city restrictions on the heights of the new buildings:

- The height of each building must be a non-negative integer.
- The height of the first building **must** be `0`.
- The height difference between any two adjacent buildings **cannot exceed** `1`.

Additionally, there are city restrictions on the maximum height of specific
buildings. These restrictions are given as a 2D integer array `restrictions`
where `restrictions[i] = [idi, maxHeighti]` indicates that building `idi` must
have a height **less than or equal to** `maxHeighti`.

It is guaranteed that each building will appear **at most once** in
`restrictions`, and building `1` will **not** be in `restrictions`.

Return _the **maximum possible height** of the **tallest** building_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 5, restrictions = [[2,1],[4,1]]
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: The green area in the image indicates the maximum allowed height for each building.
>
> We can build the buildings with heights [0,1,2,1,2], and the tallest building has a height of 2.

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 6, restrictions = []
>
> Output: 5
>
> Explanation: The green area in the image indicates the maximum allowed height for each building.
>
> We can build the buildings with heights [0,1,2,3,4,5], and the tallest building has a height of 5.

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/08/ic236-q4-ex3.png)

> Input: n = 10, restrictions = [[5,3],[2,5],[7,4],[10,3]]
>
> Output: 5
>
> Explanation: The green area in the image indicates the maximum allowed height for each building.
>
> We can build the buildings with heights [0,1,2,3,3,4,4,5,4,3], and the tallest building has a height of 5.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 10^9`
- `0 <= restrictions.length <= min(n - 1, 105)`
- `2 <= idi <= n`
- `idi` is **unique**.
- `0 <= maxHeighti <= 10^9`
