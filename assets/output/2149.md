# [2149. Rearrange Array Elements by Sign](https://leetcode.com/problems/rearrange-array-elements-by-sign)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of **even** length
consisting of an **equal** number of positive and negative integers.

You should **rearrange** the elements of `nums` such that the modified array
follows the given conditions:

  1. Every **consecutive pair** of integers have **opposite signs**.
  2. For all integers with the same sign, the **order** in which they were present in `nums` is **preserved**.
  3. The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.

Return _the modified array after rearranging the elements to satisfy the
aforementioned conditions_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [3,1,-2,-5,2,-4]
> 
> Output: [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4]
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> The positive integers in nums are [3,1,2]. The negative integers are [-2,-5,-4].
> 
> The only possible way to rearrange them such that they satisfy all conditions is [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4].
> 
> Other ways such as [1,-2,2,-5,3,-4], [3,1,2,-2,-5,-4], [-2,3,-5,1,-4,2] are incorrect because they do not satisfy one or more conditions.  

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [-1,1]
> 
> Output: [1,-1]
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> 1 is the only positive integer and -1 the only negative integer in nums.
> 
> So nums is rearranged to [1,-1].

**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 105`
  * `nums.length` is **even**
  * `1 <= |nums[i]| <= 105`
  * `nums` consists of **equal** number of positive and negative integers.
