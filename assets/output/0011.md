# [11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical
lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and
`(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the
container contains the most water.

Return _the maximum amount of water a container can store_.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

    **Input:** height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
    **Output:** 49
    **Explanation:** The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** height = [1,1]
    **Output:** 1
    



**Constraints:**

  * `n == height.length`
  * `2 <= n <= 105`
  * `0 <= height[i] <= 104`
