# [714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-transaction-fee/)

## 题目

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given
stock on the `ith` day, and an integer `fee` representing a transaction fee.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions
as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

**Note:**

  * You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
  * The transaction fee is only charged once for each stock purchase and sale.



**Example 1:**

> Input: prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2
> 
> Output: 8
> 
> Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
> - Buying at prices[0] = 1
> - Selling at prices[3] = 8
> - Buying at prices[4] = 4
> - Selling at prices[5] = 9
> 
> The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.

**Example 2:**

> Input: prices = [1,3,7,5,10,3], fee = 3
> 
> Output: 6

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= prices.length <= 5 * 104`
  * `1 <= prices[i] < 5 * 104`
  * `0 <= fee < 5 * 104`
