# [1217. Minimum Cost to Move Chips to The Same Position](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-move-chips-to-the-same-position)

## 题目

We have `n` chips, where the position of the `ith` chip is `position[i]`.

We need to move all the chips to **the same position**. In one step, we can
change the position of the `ith` chip from `position[i]` to:

  * `position[i] + 2` or `position[i] - 2` with `cost = 0`.
  * `position[i] + 1` or `position[i] - 1` with `cost = 1`.

Return _the minimum cost_ needed to move all the chips to the same position.



**Example 1:**

> Input: position = [1,2,3]
> 
> Output: 1
> 
> Explanation: First step: Move the chip at position 3 to position 1 with cost = 0.
> 
> Second step: Move the chip at position 2 to position 1 with cost = 1.
> 
> Total cost is 1.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/15/chip_e2.jpg)

> Input: position = [2,2,2,3,3]
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: We can move the two chips at position  3 to position 2. Each move has cost = 1. The total cost = 2.

**Example 3:**

> Input: position = [1,1000000000]
> 
> Output: 1

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= position.length <= 100`
  * `1 <= position[i] <= 10^9`
