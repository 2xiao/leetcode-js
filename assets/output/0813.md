# [813. Largest Sum of Averages](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-sum-of-averages)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You can partition
the array into **at most** `k` non-empty adjacent subarrays. The **score** of
a partition is the sum of the averages of each subarray.

Note that the partition must use every integer in `nums`, and that the score
is not necessarily an integer.

Return _the maximum **score** you can achieve of all the possible partitions_.
Answers within `10-6` of the actual answer will be accepted.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [9,1,2,3,9], k = 3
    **Output:** 20.00000
    **Explanation:** 
    The best choice is to partition nums into [9], [1, 2, 3], [9]. The answer is 9 + (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 + 9 = 20.
    We could have also partitioned nums into [9, 1], [2], [3, 9], for example.
    That partition would lead to a score of 5 + 2 + 6 = 13, which is worse.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 4
    **Output:** 20.50000
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 104`
  * `1 <= k <= nums.length`
