# [2108. Find First Palindromic String in the Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-palindromic-string-in-the-array)

## 题目

Given an array of strings `words`, return _the first **palindromic** string in
the array_. If there is no such string, return _an **empty string** _`""`.

A string is **palindromic** if it reads the same forward and backward.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** words = ["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"]
    **Output:** "ada"
    **Explanation:** The first string that is palindromic is "ada".
    Note that "racecar" is also palindromic, but it is not the first.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** words = ["notapalindrome","racecar"]
    **Output:** "racecar"
    **Explanation:** The first and only string that is palindromic is "racecar".
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** words = ["def","ghi"]
    **Output:** ""
    **Explanation:** There are no palindromic strings, so the empty string is returned.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= words.length <= 100`
  * `1 <= words[i].length <= 100`
  * `words[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters.
