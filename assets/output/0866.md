# [866. Prime Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/prime-palindrome)

## 题目

Given an integer n, return _the smallest **prime palindrome** greater than or
equal to _`n`.

An integer is **prime** if it has exactly two divisors: `1` and itself. Note
that `1` is not a prime number.

  * For example, `2`, `3`, `5`, `7`, `11`, and `13` are all primes.

An integer is a **palindrome** if it reads the same from left to right as it
does from right to left.

  * For example, `101` and `12321` are palindromes.

The test cases are generated so that the answer always exists and is in the
range `[2, 2 * 108]`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 6
> 
> Output: 7

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 8
> 
> Output: 11

**Example 3:**

> Input: n = 13
> 
> Output: 101

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 108`
