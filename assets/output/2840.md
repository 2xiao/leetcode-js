# [2840. Check if Strings Can be Made Equal With Operations II](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-strings-can-be-made-equal-with-operations-ii/)

## 题目

You are given two strings `s1` and `s2`, both of length `n`, consisting of
**lowercase** English letters.

You can apply the following operation on **any** of the two strings **any**
number of times:

- Choose any two indices `i` and `j` such that `i < j` and the difference `j - i` is **even** , then **swap** the two characters at those indices in the string.

Return `true` _if you can make the strings_`s1` _and_`s2` _equal, and
_`false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: s1 = "abcdba", s2 = "cabdab"
>
> Output: true
>
> Explanation: We can apply the following operations on s1:
>
> - Choose the indices i = 0, j = 2. The resulting string is s1 = "cbadba".
> - Choose the indices i = 2, j = 4. The resulting string is s1 = "cbbdaa".
> - Choose the indices i = 1, j = 5. The resulting string is s1 = "cabdab" = s2.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s1 = "abe", s2 = "bea"
>
> Output: false
>
> Explanation: It is not possible to make the two strings equal.

**Constraints:**

- `n == s1.length == s2.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `s1` and `s2` consist only of lowercase English letters.
