# [2593. Find Score of an Array After Marking All Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-score-of-an-array-after-marking-all-elements/)

## 题目

You are given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers.

Starting with `score = 0`, apply the following algorithm:

- Choose the smallest integer of the array that is not marked. If there is a tie, choose the one with the smallest index.
- Add the value of the chosen integer to `score`.
- Mark **the chosen element and its two adjacent elements if they exist**.
- Repeat until all the array elements are marked.

Return _the score you get after applying the above algorithm_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [2,1,3,4,5,2]
>
> Output: 7
>
> Explanation: We mark the elements as follows:
>
> - 1 is the smallest unmarked element, so we mark it and its two adjacent elements: [ _2_ , _1_ , _3_ ,4,5,2].
> - 2 is the smallest unmarked element, so we mark it and its left adjacent element: [ _2_ , _1_ , _3_ ,4, _5_ , _2_ ].
> - 4 is the only remaining unmarked element, so we mark it: [ _2_ , _1_ , _3_ , _4_ , _5_ , _2_ ].
>
> Our score is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [2,3,5,1,3,2]
>
> Output: 5
>
> Explanation: We mark the elements as follows:
>
> - 1 is the smallest unmarked element, so we mark it and its two adjacent elements: [2,3, _5_ , _1_ , _3_ ,2].
> - 2 is the smallest unmarked element, since there are two of them, we choose the left-most one, so we mark the one at index 0 and its right adjacent element: [ _2_ , _3_ , _5_ , _1_ , _3_ ,2].
> - 2 is the only remaining unmarked element, so we mark it: [ _2_ , _3_ , _5_ , _1_ , _3_ , _2_ ].
>
> Our score is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`
