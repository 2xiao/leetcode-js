# [503. Next Greater Element II](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii)

## 题目

Given a circular integer array `nums` (i.e., the next element of
`nums[nums.length - 1]` is `nums[0]`), return _the **next greater number** for
every element in_ `nums`.

The **next greater number** of a number `x` is the first greater number to its
traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to
find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return `-1` for this
number.



**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [1,2,1]
> 
> Output: [2,-1,2]
> 
> Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
> 
> The number 2 can't find next greater number. 
> 
> The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,3]
> 
> Output: [2,3,4,-1,4]

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
  * `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
