# [746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of `ith`
step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two
steps.

You can either start from the step with index `0`, or the step with index `1`.

Return _the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: cost = [10, _15_ ,20]
> 
> Output: 15
> 
> Explanation: You will start at index 1.
> - Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
> 
> The total cost is 15.

**Example 2:**

> Input: cost = [ _1_ ,100, _1_ ,1, _1_ ,100, _1_ , _1_ ,100, _1_ ]
> 
> Output: 6
> 
> Explanation: You will start at index 0.
> - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
> - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
> - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
> - Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
> - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
> - Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
> 
> The total cost is 6.

**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= cost.length <= 1000`
  * `0 <= cost[i] <= 999`
