# [401. Binary Watch](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-watch)

## 题目

A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top to represent the hours (0-11), and 6 LEDs
on the bottom to represent the minutes (0-59). Each LED represents a zero or
one, with the least significant bit on the right.

  * For example, the below binary watch reads `"4:51"`.

Given an integer `turnedOn` which represents the number of LEDs that are
currently on (ignoring the PM), return _all possible times the watch could
represent_. You may return the answer in **any order**.

The hour must not contain a leading zero.

  * For example, `"01:00"` is not valid. It should be `"1:00"`.

The minute must consist of two digits and may contain a leading zero.

  * For example, `"10:2"` is not valid. It should be `"10:02"`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** turnedOn = 1
    **Output:** ["0:01","0:02","0:04","0:08","0:16","0:32","1:00","2:00","4:00","8:00"]
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** turnedOn = 9
    **Output:** []
    



**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= turnedOn <= 10`
