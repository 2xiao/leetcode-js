# [140. Word Break II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break-ii)

## 题目

Given a string `s` and a dictionary of strings `wordDict`, add spaces in `s`
to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word. Return all
such possible sentences in **any order**.

**Note** that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in
the segmentation.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "catsanddog", wordDict = ["cat","cats","and","sand","dog"]
    **Output:** ["cats and dog","cat sand dog"]
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "pineapplepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen","applepen","pine","pineapple"]
    **Output:** ["pine apple pen apple","pineapple pen apple","pine applepen apple"]
    **Explanation:** Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
    **Output:** []
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 20`
  * `1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000`
  * `1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 10`
  * `s` and `wordDict[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters.
  * All the strings of `wordDict` are **unique**.
  * Input is generated in a way that the length of the answer doesn't exceed 105.
