# [2185. Counting Words With a Given Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-words-with-a-given-prefix)

## 题目

You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `pref`.

Return _the number of strings in_`words` _that contain_`pref` _as a
**prefix**_.

A **prefix** of a string `s` is any leading contiguous substring of `s`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** words = ["pay"," ** _at_** tention","practice"," _ **at**_ tend"], pref = "at"
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** The 2 strings that contain "at" as a prefix are: " _ **at**_ tention" and " _ **at**_ tend".
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** words = ["leetcode","win","loops","success"], pref = "code"
    **Output:** 0
    **Explanation:** There are no strings that contain "code" as a prefix.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= words.length <= 100`
  * `1 <= words[i].length, pref.length <= 100`
  * `words[i]` and `pref` consist of lowercase English letters.
