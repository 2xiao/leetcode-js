# [2196. Create Binary Tree From Descriptions](https://leetcode.com/problems/create-binary-tree-from-descriptions)

## 题目

You are given a 2D integer array `descriptions` where `descriptions[i] =
[parenti, childi, isLefti]` indicates that `parenti` is the **parent** of
`childi` in a **binary** tree of **unique** values. Furthermore,

  * If `isLefti == 1`, then `childi` is the left child of `parenti`.
  * If `isLefti == 0`, then `childi` is the right child of `parenti`.

Construct the binary tree described by `descriptions` and return _its
**root**_.

The test cases will be generated such that the binary tree is **valid**.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/02/09/example1drawio.png)

> Input: descriptions = [[20,15,1],[20,17,0],[50,20,1],[50,80,0],[80,19,1]]
> 
> Output: [50,20,80,15,17,19]
> 
> Explanation: The root node is the node with value 50 since it has no parent.
> 
> The resulting binary tree is shown in the diagram.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/02/09/example2drawio.png)

> Input: descriptions = [[1,2,1],[2,3,0],[3,4,1]]
> 
> Output: [1,2,null,null,3,4]
> 
> Explanation: The root node is the node with value 1 since it has no parent.
> 
> The resulting binary tree is shown in the diagram.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= descriptions.length <= 104`
  * `descriptions[i].length == 3`
  * `1 <= parenti, childi <= 105`
  * `0 <= isLefti <= 1`
  * The binary tree described by `descriptions` is valid.
