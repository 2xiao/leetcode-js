# [210. Course Schedule II](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/)

## 题目

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0`
to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where
`prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi`
first if you want to take course `ai`.

  * For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return _the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses_. If
there are many valid answers, return **any** of them. If it is impossible to
finish all courses, return **an empty array**.



**Example 1:**

> Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
> 
> Output: [0,1]
> 
> Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].

**Example 2:**

> Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
> 
> Output: [0,2,1,3]
> 
> Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
> 
> So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].

**Example 3:**

> Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
> 
> Output: [0]

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
  * `0 <= prerequisites.length <= numCourses * (numCourses - 1)`
  * `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
  * `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
  * `ai != bi`
  * All the pairs `[ai, bi]` are **distinct**.
