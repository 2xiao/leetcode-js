# [2642. Design Graph With Shortest Path Calculator](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-graph-with-shortest-path-calculator/)

## 题目

There is a **directed weighted** graph that consists of `n` nodes numbered
from `0` to `n - 1`. The edges of the graph are initially represented by the
given array `edges` where `edges[i] = [fromi, toi, edgeCosti]` meaning that
there is an edge from `fromi` to `toi` with the cost `edgeCosti`.

Implement the `Graph` class:

  * `Graph(int n, int[][] edges)` initializes the object with `n` nodes and the given edges.
  * `addEdge(int[] edge)` adds an edge to the list of edges where `edge = [from, to, edgeCost]`. It is guaranteed that there is no edge between the two nodes before adding this one.
  * `int shortestPath(int node1, int node2)` returns the **minimum** cost of a path from `node1` to `node2`. If no path exists, return `-1`. The cost of a path is the sum of the costs of the edges in the path.

> Graph g = new Graph(4, [[0, 2, 5], [0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 3]]);
> 
> g.shortestPath(3, 2); // return 6. The shortest path from 3 to 2 in the first diagram above is 3 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2 with a total cost of 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.
> 
> g.shortestPath(0, 3); // return -1. There is no path from 0 to 3.
> 
> g.addEdge([1, 3, 4]); // We add an edge from node 1 to node 3, and we get the second diagram above.
> 
> g.shortestPath(0, 3); // return 6. The shortest path from 0 to 3 now is 0 -> 1 -> 3 with a total cost of 2 + 4 = 6.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 100`
  * `0 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1)`
  * `edges[i].length == edge.length == 3`
  * `0 <= fromi, toi, from, to, node1, node2 <= n - 1`
  * `1 <= edgeCosti, edgeCost <= 106`
  * There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph at any point.
  * At most `100` calls will be made for `addEdge`.
  * At most `100` calls will be made for `shortestPath`.
