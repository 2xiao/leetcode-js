# [227. Basic Calculator II](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator-ii)

## 题目

Given a string `s` which represents an expression, _evaluate this expression
and return its value_.

The integer division should truncate toward zero.

You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate
results will be in the range of `[-231, 231 - 1]`.

**Note:** You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates
strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "3+2*2"
    **Output:** 7
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = " 3/2 "
    **Output:** 1
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = " 3+5 / 2 "
    **Output:** 5
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105`
  * `s` consists of integers and operators `('+', '-', '*', '/')` separated by some number of spaces.
  * `s` represents **a valid expression**.
  * All the integers in the expression are non-negative integers in the range `[0, 231 - 1]`.
  * The answer is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit integer**.
