# [3170. Lexicographically Minimum String After Removing Stars](https://leetcode.com/problems/lexicographically-minimum-string-after-removing-stars/)

## 题目

You are given a string `s`. It may contain any number of `'*'` characters.
Your task is to remove all `'*'` characters.

While there is a `'*'`, do the following operation:

- Delete the leftmost `'*'` and the **smallest** non-`'*'` character to its _left_. If there are several smallest characters, you can delete any of them.

Return the lexicographically smallest resulting string after removing all
`'*'` characters.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "aaba\*"

**Output:** "aab"

**Explanation:**

We should delete one of the `'a'` characters with `'*'`. If we choose `s[3]`,
`s` becomes the lexicographically smallest.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "abc"

**Output:** "abc"

**Explanation:**

There is no `'*'` in the string.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters and `'*'`.
- The input is generated such that it is possible to delete all `'*'` characters.
