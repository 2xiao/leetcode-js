# [516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence)

## 题目

Given a string `s`, find _the longest palindromic **subsequence** 's length
in_ `s`.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by
deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining
elements.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "bbbab"
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "cbbd"
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
  * `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
