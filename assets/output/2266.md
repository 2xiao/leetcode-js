# [2266. Count Number of Texts](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-texts)

## 题目

Alice is texting Bob using her phone. The **mapping** of digits to letters is
shown in the figure below.

In order to **add** a letter, Alice has to **press** the key of the
corresponding digit `i` times, where `i` is the position of the letter in the
key.

  * For example, to add the letter `'s'`, Alice has to press `'7'` four times. Similarly, to add the letter `'k'`, Alice has to press `'5'` twice.
  * Note that the digits `'0'` and `'1'` do not map to any letters, so Alice **does not** use them.

However, due to an error in transmission, Bob did not receive Alice's text
message but received a **string of pressed keys** instead.

  * For example, when Alice sent the message `"bob"`, Bob received the string `"2266622"`.

Given a string `pressedKeys` representing the string received by Bob, return
_the **total number of possible text messages** Alice could have sent_.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** pressedKeys = "22233"
    **Output:** 8
    **Explanation:**
    The possible text messages Alice could have sent are:
    "aaadd", "abdd", "badd", "cdd", "aaae", "abe", "bae", and "ce".
    Since there are 8 possible messages, we return 8.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** pressedKeys = "222222222222222222222222222222222222"
    **Output:** 82876089
    **Explanation:**
    There are 2082876103 possible text messages Alice could have sent.
    Since we need to return the answer modulo 109 + 7, we return 2082876103 % (109 + 7) = 82876089.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= pressedKeys.length <= 105`
  * `pressedKeys` only consists of digits from `'2'` \- `'9'`.
