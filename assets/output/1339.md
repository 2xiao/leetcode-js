# [1339. Maximum Product of Splitted Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-splitted-binary-tree/)

## 题目

Given the `root` of a binary tree, split the binary tree into two subtrees by
removing one edge such that the product of the sums of the subtrees is
maximized.

Return _the maximum product of the sums of the two subtrees_. Since the answer
may be too large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Note** that you need to maximize the answer before taking the mod and not
after taking it.

**Example 1:**

> Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
>
> Output: 110
>
> Explanation: Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 11 and 10. Their product is 110 (11\*10)

**Example 2:**

> Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,null,null,5,6]
>
> Output: 90
>
> Explanation: Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 15 and 6.Their product is 90 (15\*6)

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 5 * 10^4]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^4`
