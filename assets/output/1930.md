# [1930. Unique Length-3 Palindromic Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-length-3-palindromic-subsequences/)

## 题目

Given a string `s`, return _the number of **unique palindromes of length
three** that are a **subsequence** of _`s`.

Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it
is still only counted **once**.

A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original
string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the
relative order of the remaining characters.

  * For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `" _a_ b _c_ d _e_ "`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "aabca"
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation: The 3 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
> - "aba" (subsequence of " _a_ a _b_ c _a_ ")
> - "aaa" (subsequence of " _aa_ bc _a_ ")
> - "aca" (subsequence of " _a_ ab _ca_ ")

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "adc"
> 
> Output: 0
> 
> Explanation: There are no palindromic subsequences of length 3 in "adc".

**Example 3:**

> Input: s = "bbcbaba"
> 
> Output: 4
> 
> Explanation: The 4 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
> - "bbb" (subsequence of " _bb_ c _b_ aba")
> - "bcb" (subsequence of " _b_ b _cb_ aba")
> - "bab" (subsequence of " _b_ bcb _ab_ a")
> - "aba" (subsequence of "bbcb _aba_ ")

**Constraints:**

  * `3 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
