Write a solution to find the **longest successful pass streak** for **each
team** during the match. The rules are as follows:

  * A successful pass streak is defined as consecutive passes where: 
> 
> * Both the `pass_from` and `pass_to` players belong to the same team
  * A streak breaks when either: 
> 
> * The pass is intercepted (received by a player from the opposing team)

Return _the result table ordered by_ `team_name` _in**ascending** order_.

The result format is in the following example.



**Example:**

**Input:**

Teams table:

> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> +-----------+-----------+
> 
> | player_id | team_name |
> 
> +-----------+-----------+

**Output:**

>

> 
> +-----------+----------------+
> 
> | team_name | longest_streak |
>

>

>   |
> 
> | Chelsea   | 4> 
> > 
> > 
>   |
> 
> +-----------+----------------+
> 
> 

**Explanation:**

  * **Arsenal** 's streaks: 
> 
> * First streak: 3 passes (1->2->3->4) ended when player 4 passed to Chelsea's player 5
> 
> * Second streak: 2 passes (1->2->3)
> 
> * Longest streak = 3
  * **Chelsea** 's streaks: 
> 
> * First streak: 3 passes (6->7->8->6->5)
> 
> * Longest streak = 4
