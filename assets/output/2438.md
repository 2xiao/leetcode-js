# [2438. Range Product Queries of Powers](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-product-queries-of-powers/)

## 题目

Given a positive integer `n`, there exists a **0-indexed** array called
`powers`, composed of the **minimum** number of powers of `2` that sum to `n`.
The array is sorted in **non-decreasing** order, and there is **only one** way
to form the array.

You are also given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `queries`, where
`queries[i] = [lefti, righti]`. Each `queries[i]` represents a query where you
have to find the product of all `powers[j]` with `lefti <= j <= righti`.

Return _an array_`answers` _, equal in length to_`queries` _,
where_`answers[i]` _is the answer to the_`ith` _query_. Since the answer to
the `ith` query may be too large, each `answers[i]` should be returned
**modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 15, queries = [[0,1],[2,2],[0,3]]
>
> Output: [2,4,64]
>
> Explanation:
>
> For n = 15, powers = [1,2,4,8]. It can be shown that powers cannot be a smaller size.
>
> Answer to 1st query: powers[0] _ powers[1] = 1 _ 2 = 2.
>
> Answer to 2nd query: powers[2] = 4.
>
> Answer to 3rd query: powers[0] _ powers[1] _ powers[2] _ powers[3] = 1 _ 2 _ 4 _ 8 = 64.
>
> Each answer modulo 109 + 7 yields the same answer, so [2,4,64] is returned.

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 2, queries = [[0,0]]
>
> Output: [2]
>
> Explanation:
>
> For n = 2, powers = [2].
>
> The answer to the only query is powers[0] = 2. The answer modulo 109 + 7 is the same, so [2] is returned.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10^9`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= starti <= endi < powers.length`
