# [3200. Maximum Height of a Triangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-height-of-a-triangle/)

## 题目

You are given two integers `red` and `blue` representing the count of red and
blue colored balls. You have to arrange these balls to form a triangle such
that the 1st row will have 1 ball, the 2nd row will have 2 balls, the 3rd row
will have 3 balls, and so on.

All the balls in a particular row should be the **same** color, and adjacent
rows should have **different** colors.

Return the **maximum** _height of the triangle_ that can be achieved.
