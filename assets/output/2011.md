# [2011. Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations](https://leetcode.com/problems/final-value-of-variable-after-performing-operations)

## 题目

There is a programming language with only **four** operations and **one**
variable `X`:

  * `++X` and `X++` **increments** the value of the variable `X` by `1`.
  * `--X` and `X--` **decrements** the value of the variable `X` by `1`.

Initially, the value of `X` is `0`.

Given an array of strings `operations` containing a list of operations, return
_the **final** value of _`X` _after performing all the operations_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]
> 
> Output: 1
> 
> Explanation:  The operations are performed as follows:
> 
> Initially, X = 0.
> 
> --X: X is decremented by 1, X =  0 - 1 = -1.
> 
> X++: X is incremented by 1, X = -1 + 1 =  0.
> 
> X++: X is incremented by 1, X =  0 + 1 =  1.

**Example 2:**

> Input: operations = ["++X","++X","X++"]
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
> 
> Initially, X = 0.
> 
> ++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
> 
> ++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
> 
> X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 2 + 1 = 3.

**Example 3:**

> Input: operations = ["X++","++X","--X","X--"]
> 
> Output: 0
> 
> Explanation:  The operations are performed as follows:
> 
> Initially, X = 0.
> 
> X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
> 
> ++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
> 
> --X: X is decremented by 1, X = 2 - 1 = 1.
> 
> X--: X is decremented by 1, X = 1 - 1 = 0.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= operations.length <= 100`
  * `operations[i]` will be either `"++X"`, `"X++"`, `"--X"`, or `"X--"`.
