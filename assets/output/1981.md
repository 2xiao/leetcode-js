# [1981. Minimize the Difference Between Target and Chosen Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-the-difference-between-target-and-chosen-elements/)

## 题目

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `mat` and an integer `target`.

Choose one integer from **each row** in the matrix such that the **absolute
difference** between `target` and the **sum** of the chosen elements is
**minimized**.

Return _the **minimum absolute difference**_.

The **absolute difference** between two numbers `a` and `b` is the absolute
value of `a - b`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: mat = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], target = 13
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation: One possible choice is to:
>
> - Choose 1 from the first row.
> - Choose 5 from the second row.
> - Choose 7 from the third row.
>
> The sum of the chosen elements is 13, which equals the target, so the absolute difference is 0.

**Example 2:**

> Input: mat = [[1],[2],[3]], target = 100
>
> Output: 94
>
> Explanation: The best possible choice is to:
>
> - Choose 1 from the first row.
> - Choose 2 from the second row.
> - Choose 3 from the third row.
>
> The sum of the chosen elements is 6, and the absolute difference is 94.

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/03/matrix1-3.png)

> Input: mat = [[1,2,9,8,7]], target = 6
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation: The best choice is to choose 7 from the first row.
>
> The absolute difference is 1.

**Constraints:**

- `m == mat.length`
- `n == mat[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 70`
- `1 <= mat[i][j] <= 70`
- `1 <= target <= 800`
