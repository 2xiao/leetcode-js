# [3154. Find Number of Ways to Reach the K-th Stair](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-number-of-ways-to-reach-the-k-th-stair/)

## 题目

You are given a **non-negative** integer `k`. There exists a staircase with an
infinite number of stairs, with the **lowest** stair numbered 0.

Alice has an integer `jump`, with an initial value of 0. She starts on stair 1
and wants to reach stair `k` using **any** number of **operations**. If she is
on stair `i`, in one **operation** she can:

- Go down to stair `i - 1`. This operation **cannot** be used consecutively or on stair 0.
- Go up to stair `i + 2jump`. And then, `jump` becomes `jump + 1`.

Return the _total_ number of ways Alice can reach stair `k`.

**Note** that it is possible that Alice reaches the stair `k`, and performs
some operations to reach the stair `k` again.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** k = 0

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The 2 possible ways of reaching stair 0 are:

- Alice starts at stair 1.
  > - Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.
- Alice starts at stair 1.
  > - Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.
  >
  > - Using an operation of the second type, she goes up 20 stairs to reach stair 1.
  >
  > - Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** k = 1

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

The 4 possible ways of reaching stair 1 are:

- Alice starts at stair 1. Alice is at stair 1.
- Alice starts at stair 1.
  > - Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.
  >
  > - Using an operation of the second type, she goes up 20 stairs to reach stair 1.
- Alice starts at stair 1.
  > - Using an operation of the second type, she goes up 20 stairs to reach stair 2.
  >
  > - Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 1.
- Alice starts at stair 1.
  > - Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.
  >
  > - Using an operation of the second type, she goes up 20 stairs to reach stair 1.
  >
  > - Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.
  >
  > - Using an operation of the second type, she goes up 21 stairs to reach stair 2.
  >
  > - Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 1.

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= k <= 10^9`
