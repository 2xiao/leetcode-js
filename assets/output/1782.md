# [1782. Count Pairs Of Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-pairs-of-nodes)

## 题目

You are given an undirected graph defined by an integer `n`, the number of
nodes, and a 2D integer array `edges`, the edges in the graph, where `edges[i]
= [ui, vi]` indicates that there is an **undirected** edge between `ui` and
`vi`. You are also given an integer array `queries`.

Let `incident(a, b)` be defined as the **number of edges** that are connected
to **either** node `a` or `b`.

The answer to the `jth` query is the **number of pairs** of nodes `(a, b)`
that satisfy **both** of the following conditions:

  * `a < b`
  * `incident(a, b) > queries[j]`

Return _an array_`answers` _such that_`answers.length == queries.length`
_and_`answers[j]` _is the answer of the_`jth` _query_.

Note that there can be **multiple edges** between the same two nodes.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/08/winword_2021-06-08_00-58-39.png)

    
    
    **Input:** n = 4, edges = [[1,2],[2,4],[1,3],[2,3],[2,1]], queries = [2,3]
    **Output:** [6,5]
    **Explanation:** The calculations for incident(a, b) are shown in the table above.
    The answers for each of the queries are as follows:
    - answers[0] = 6. All the pairs have an incident(a, b) value greater than 2.
    - answers[1] = 5. All the pairs except (3, 4) have an incident(a, b) value greater than 3.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 5, edges = [[1,5],[1,5],[3,4],[2,5],[1,3],[5,1],[2,3],[2,5]], queries = [1,2,3,4,5]
    **Output:** [10,10,9,8,6]
    



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= n <= 2 * 104`
  * `1 <= edges.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= ui, vi <= n`
  * `ui != vi`
  * `1 <= queries.length <= 20`
  * `0 <= queries[j] < edges.length`
