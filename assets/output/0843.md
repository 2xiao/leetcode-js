# [843. Guess the Word](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-the-word/)

## 题目

You are given an array of unique strings `words` where `words[i]` is six
letters long. One word of `words` was chosen as a secret word.

You are also given the helper object `Master`. You may call
`Master.guess(word)` where `word` is a six-letter-long string, and it must be
from `words`. `Master.guess(word)` returns:

  * `-1` if `word` is not from `words`, or
  * an integer representing the number of exact matches (value and position) of your guess to the secret word.

There is a parameter `allowedGuesses` for each test case where
`allowedGuesses` is the maximum number of times you can call
`Master.guess(word)`.

For each test case, you should call `Master.guess` with the secret word
without exceeding the maximum number of allowed guesses. You will get:

  * **`"Either you took too many guesses, or you did not find the secret word."`** if you called `Master.guess` more than `allowedGuesses` times or if you did not call `Master.guess` with the secret word, or
  * **`"You guessed the secret word correctly."`** if you called `Master.guess` with the secret word with the number of calls to `Master.guess` less than or equal to `allowedGuesses`.

The test cases are generated such that you can guess the secret word with a
reasonable strategy (other than using the bruteforce method).



**Example 1:**

> Input: secret = "acckzz", words = ["acckzz","ccbazz","eiowzz","abcczz"], allowedGuesses = 10
> 
> Output: You guessed the secret word correctly.
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> master.guess("aaaaaa") returns -1, because "aaaaaa" is not in wordlist.
> 
> master.guess("acckzz") returns 6, because "acckzz" is secret and has all 6 matches.
> 
> master.guess("ccbazz") returns 3, because "ccbazz" has 3 matches.
> 
> master.guess("eiowzz") returns 2, because "eiowzz" has 2 matches.
> 
> master.guess("abcczz") returns 4, because "abcczz" has 4 matches.
> 
> We made 5 calls to master.guess, and one of them was the secret, so we pass the test case.

**Example 2:**

> Input: secret = "hamada", words = ["hamada","khaled"], allowedGuesses = 10
> 
> Output: You guessed the secret word correctly.
> 
> Explanation: Since there are two words, you can guess both.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= words.length <= 100`
  * `words[i].length == 6`
  * `words[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
  * All the strings of `wordlist` are **unique**.
  * `secret` exists in `words`.
  * `10 <= allowedGuesses <= 30`
