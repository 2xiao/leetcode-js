# [3098. Find the Sum of Subsequence Powers](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-sum-of-subsequence-powers/)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, and a **positive**
integer `k`.

The **power** of a subsequence is defined as the **minimum** absolute
difference between **any** two elements in the subsequence.

Return _the**sum** of **powers** of **all** subsequences of _`nums` _which
have length_ **_equal to_** `k`.

Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 3

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

There are 4 subsequences in `nums` which have length 3: `[1,2,3]`, `[1,3,4]`,
`[1,2,4]`, and `[2,3,4]`. The sum of powers is `|2 - 3| + |3 - 4| + |2 - 1| +
|3 - 4| = 4`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2,2], k = 2

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

The only subsequence in `nums` which has length 2 is `[2,2]`. The sum of
powers is `|2 - 2| = 0`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [4,3,-1], k = 2

**Output:** 10

**Explanation:**

There are 3 subsequences in `nums` which have length 2: `[4,3]`, `[4,-1]`, and
`[3,-1]`. The sum of powers is `|4 - 3| + |4 - (-1)| + |3 - (-1)| = 10`.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n == nums.length <= 50`
- `-10^8 <= nums[i] <= 108 `
- `2 <= k <= n`
