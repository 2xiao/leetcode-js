# [2493. Divide Nodes Into the Maximum Number of Groups](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-nodes-into-the-maximum-number-of-groups)

## 题目

You are given a positive integer `n` representing the number of nodes in an
**undirected** graph. The nodes are labeled from `1` to `n`.

You are also given a 2D integer array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]`
indicates that there is a **bidirectional** edge between nodes `ai` and `bi`.
**Notice** that the given graph may be disconnected.

Divide the nodes of the graph into `m` groups ( **1-indexed** ) such that:

  * Each node in the graph belongs to exactly one group.
  * For every pair of nodes in the graph that are connected by an edge `[ai, bi]`, if `ai` belongs to the group with index `x`, and `bi` belongs to the group with index `y`, then `|y - x| = 1`.

Return _the maximum number of groups (i.e., maximum_`m` _) into which you can
divide the nodes_. Return `-1` _if it is impossible to group the nodes with
the given conditions_.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/13/example1.png)

    
    
    **Input:** n = 6, edges = [[1,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,6],[2,3],[4,6]]
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** As shown in the image we:
    - Add node 5 to the first group.
    - Add node 1 to the second group.
    - Add nodes 2 and 4 to the third group.
    - Add nodes 3 and 6 to the fourth group.
    We can see that every edge is satisfied.
    It can be shown that that if we create a fifth group and move any node from the third or fourth group to it, at least on of the edges will not be satisfied.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 3, edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
    **Output:** -1
    **Explanation:** If we add node 1 to the first group, node 2 to the second group, and node 3 to the third group to satisfy the first two edges, we can see that the third edge will not be satisfied.
    It can be shown that no grouping is possible.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 500`
  * `1 <= edges.length <= 104`
  * `edges[i].length == 2`
  * `1 <= ai, bi <= n`
  * `ai != bi`
  * There is at most one edge between any pair of vertices.
