# [1723. Find Minimum Time to Finish All Jobs](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-time-to-finish-all-jobs/)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `jobs`, where `jobs[i]` is the amount of time
it takes to complete the `ith` job.

There are `k` workers that you can assign jobs to. Each job should be assigned
to **exactly** one worker. The **working time** of a worker is the sum of the
time it takes to complete all jobs assigned to them. Your goal is to devise an
optimal assignment such that the **maximum working time** of any worker is
**minimized**.

_Return the **minimum** possible **maximum working time** of any assignment. _

**Example 1:**

> Input: jobs = [3,2,3], k = 3
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: By assigning each person one job, the maximum time is 3.

**Example 2:**

> Input: jobs = [1,2,4,7,8], k = 2
>
> Output: 11
>
> Explanation: Assign the jobs the following way:
>
> Worker 1: 1, 2, 8 (working time = 1 + 2 + 8 = 11)
>
> Worker 2: 4, 7 (working time = 4 + 7 = 11)
>
> The maximum working time is 11.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= jobs.length <= 12`
- `1 <= jobs[i] <= 10^7`
