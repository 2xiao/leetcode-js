# [754. Reach a Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/reach-a-number/)

## 题目

You are standing at position `0` on an infinite number line. There is a
destination at position `target`.

You can make some number of moves `numMoves` so that:

- On each move, you can either go left or right.
- During the `ith` move (starting from `i == 1` to `i == numMoves`), you take `i` steps in the chosen direction.

Given the integer `target`, return _the **minimum** number of moves required
(i.e., the minimum _`numMoves` _) to reach the destination_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: target = 2
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation:
>
> On the 1st move, we step from 0 to 1 (1 step).
>
> On the 2nd move, we step from 1 to -1 (2 steps).
>
> On the 3rd move, we step from -1 to 2 (3 steps).

**Example 2:**

> Input: target = 3
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation:
>
> On the 1st move, we step from 0 to 1 (1 step).
>
> On the 2nd move, we step from 1 to 3 (2 steps).

**Constraints:**

- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`
- `target != 0`
