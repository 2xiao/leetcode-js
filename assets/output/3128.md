# [3128. Right Triangles](https://leetcode.com/problems/right-triangles/)

## 题目

You are given a 2D boolean matrix `grid`.

A collection of 3 elements of `grid` is a **right triangle** if one of its
elements is in the **same row** with another element and in the **same
column** with the third element. The 3 elements may **not** be next to each
other.

Return an integer that is the number of **right triangles** that can be made
with 3 elements of `grid` such that **all** of them have a value of 1.

**Example 1:**

| 0   | 1   | 0   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   |

**Input:** grid = [[0,1,0],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

There are two right triangles with elements of the value 1. Notice that the
blue ones do **not **form a right triangle because the 3 elements are in the
same column.

**Example 2:**

| 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   |

**Input:** grid = [[1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,1],[1,0,0,0]]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

There are no right triangles with elements of the value 1. Notice that the
blue ones do **not** form a right triangle.

**Example 3:**

| 1   | 0   | 1   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   |

**Input:** grid = [[1,0,1],[1,0,0],[1,0,0]]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

There are two right triangles with elements of the value 1.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= grid.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= grid[i].length <= 1000`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 1`
