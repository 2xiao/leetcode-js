# [2332. The Latest Time to Catch a Bus](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-latest-time-to-catch-a-bus/)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `buses` of length `n`, where
`buses[i]` represents the departure time of the `ith` bus. You are also given
a **0-indexed** integer array `passengers` of length `m`, where
`passengers[j]` represents the arrival time of the `jth` passenger. All bus
departure times are unique. All passenger arrival times are unique.

You are given an integer `capacity`, which represents the **maximum** number
of passengers that can get on each bus.

When a passenger arrives, they will wait in line for the next available bus.
You can get on a bus that departs at `x` minutes if you arrive at `y` minutes
where `y <= x`, and the bus is not full. Passengers with the **earliest**
arrival times get on the bus first.

More formally when a bus arrives, either:

- If `capacity` or fewer passengers are waiting for a bus, they will **all** get on the bus, or
- The `capacity` passengers with the **earliest** arrival times will get on the bus.

Return _the latest time you may arrive at the bus station to catch a bus_. You
**cannot** arrive at the same time as another passenger.

**Note:** The arrays `buses` and `passengers` are not necessarily sorted.

**Example 1:**

> Input: buses = [10,20], passengers = [2,17,18,19], capacity = 2
>
> Output: 16
>
> Explanation: Suppose you arrive at time 16.
>
> At time 10, the first bus departs with the 0th passenger.
>
> At time 20, the second bus departs with you and the 1st passenger.
>
> Note that you may not arrive at the same time as another passenger, which is why you must arrive before the 1st passenger to catch the bus.

**Example 2:**

> Input: buses = [20,30,10], passengers = [19,13,26,4,25,11,21], capacity = 2
>
> Output: 20
>
> Explanation: Suppose you arrive at time 20.
>
> At time 10, the first bus departs with the 3rd passenger.
>
> At time 20, the second bus departs with the 5th and 1st passengers.
>
> At time 30, the third bus departs with the 0th passenger and you.
>
> Notice if you had arrived any later, then the 6th passenger would have taken your seat on the third bus.

**Constraints:**

- `n == buses.length`
- `m == passengers.length`
- `1 <= n, m, capacity <= 10^5`
- `2 <= buses[i], passengers[i] <= 10^9`
- Each element in `buses` is **unique**.
- Each element in `passengers` is **unique**.
