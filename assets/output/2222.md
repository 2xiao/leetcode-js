# [2222. Number of Ways to Select Buildings](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-select-buildings/)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** binary string `s` which represents the types of
buildings along a street where:

  * `s[i] = '0'` denotes that the `ith` building is an office and
  * `s[i] = '1'` denotes that the `ith` building is a restaurant.

As a city official, you would like to **select** 3 buildings for random
inspection. However, to ensure variety, **no two consecutive** buildings out
of the **selected** buildings can be of the same type.

  * For example, given `s = "0 _ **0**_ 1 _ **1**_ 0 _ **1**_ "`, we cannot select the `1st`, `3rd`, and `5th` buildings as that would form `"0 ** _11_** "` which is **not** allowed due to having two consecutive buildings of the same type.

Return _the **number of valid ways** to select 3 buildings._



**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "001101"
> 
> Output: 6
> 
> Explanation: 
> 
> The following sets of indices selected are valid:
> - [0,2,4] from " _ **0**_ 0 ** _1_** 1 ** _0_** 1" forms "010"
> - [0,3,4] from " _ **0**_ 01 _ **10**_ 1" forms "010"
> - [1,2,4] from "0 _ **01**_ 1 _ **0**_ 1" forms "010"
> - [1,3,4] from "0 _ **0**_ 1 _ **10**_ 1" forms "010"
> - [2,4,5] from "00 _ **1**_ 1 _ **01**_ " forms "101"
> - [3,4,5] from "001 _ **101**_ " forms "101"
> 
> No other selection is valid. Thus, there are 6 total ways.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "11100"
> 
> Output: 0
> 
> Explanation: It can be shown that there are no valid selections.

**Constraints:**

  * `3 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
