# [2402. Meeting Rooms III](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-iii/)

## 题目

You are given an integer `n`. There are `n` rooms numbered from `0` to `n -
1`.

You are given a 2D integer array `meetings` where `meetings[i] = [starti,
endi]` means that a meeting will be held during the **half-closed** time
interval `[starti, endi)`. All the values of `starti` are **unique**.

Meetings are allocated to rooms in the following manner:

1. Each meeting will take place in the unused room with the **lowest** number.
2. If there are no available rooms, the meeting will be delayed until a room becomes free. The delayed meeting should have the **same** duration as the original meeting.
3. When a room becomes unused, meetings that have an earlier original **start** time should be given the room.

Return _the **number** of the room that held the most meetings. \_If there are
multiple rooms, return \_the room with the **lowest** number._

A **half-closed interval** `[a, b)` is the interval between `a` and `b`
**including** `a` and **not including** `b`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 2, meetings = [[0,10],[1,5],[2,7],[3,4]]
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation:
>
> - At time 0, both rooms are not being used. The first meeting starts in room 0.
> - At time 1, only room 1 is not being used. The second meeting starts in room 1.
> - At time 2, both rooms are being used. The third meeting is delayed.
> - At time 3, both rooms are being used. The fourth meeting is delayed.
> - At time 5, the meeting in room 1 finishes. The third meeting starts in room 1 for the time period [5,10).
> - At time 10, the meetings in both rooms finish. The fourth meeting starts in room 0 for the time period [10,11).
>
> Both rooms 0 and 1 held 2 meetings, so we return 0.

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 3, meetings = [[1,20],[2,10],[3,5],[4,9],[6,8]]
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation:
>
> - At time 1, all three rooms are not being used. The first meeting starts in room 0.
> - At time 2, rooms 1 and 2 are not being used. The second meeting starts in room 1.
> - At time 3, only room 2 is not being used. The third meeting starts in room 2.
> - At time 4, all three rooms are being used. The fourth meeting is delayed.
> - At time 5, the meeting in room 2 finishes. The fourth meeting starts in room 2 for the time period [5,10).
> - At time 6, all three rooms are being used. The fifth meeting is delayed.
> - At time 10, the meetings in rooms 1 and 2 finish. The fifth meeting starts in room 1 for the time period [10,12).
>
> Room 0 held 1 meeting while rooms 1 and 2 each held 2 meetings, so we return 1.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= meetings.length <= 10^5`
- `meetings[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 10^5`
- All the values of `starti` are **unique**.
