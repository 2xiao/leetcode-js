# [236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/)

## 题目

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes
in the tree.

According to the [definition of LCA on
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): "The lowest
common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in
`T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a
descendant of itself** )."

**Example 1:**

> Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

> Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
>
> Output: 5
>
> Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

**Example 3:**

> Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
>
> Output: 1

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 105]`.
- `-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
- All `Node.val` are **unique**.
- `p != q`
- `p` and `q` will exist in the tree.
