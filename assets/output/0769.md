# [769. Max Chunks To Make Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-chunks-to-make-sorted/)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `arr` of length `n` that represents a
permutation of the integers in the range `[0, n - 1]`.

We split `arr` into some number of **chunks** (i.e., partitions), and
individually sort each chunk. After concatenating them, the result should
equal the sorted array.

Return _the largest number of chunks we can make to sort the array_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: arr = [4,3,2,1,0]
> 
> Output: 1
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> Splitting into two or more chunks will not return the required result.
> 
> For example, splitting into [4, 3], [2, 1, 0] will result in [3, 4, 0, 1, 2], which isn't sorted.

**Example 2:**

> Input: arr = [1,0,2,3,4]
> 
> Output: 4
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> We can split into two chunks, such as [1, 0], [2, 3, 4].
> 
> However, splitting into [1, 0], [2], [3], [4] is the highest number of chunks possible.

**Constraints:**

  * `n == arr.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 10`
  * `0 <= arr[i] < n`
  * All the elements of `arr` are **unique**.
