# [312. Burst Balloons](https://leetcode.com/problems/burst-balloons)

## 题目

You are given `n` balloons, indexed from `0` to `n - 1`. Each balloon is
painted with a number on it represented by an array `nums`. You are asked to
burst all the balloons.

If you burst the `ith` balloon, you will get `nums[i - 1] * nums[i] * nums[i +
1]` coins. If `i - 1` or `i + 1` goes out of bounds of the array, then treat
it as if there is a balloon with a `1` painted on it.

Return _the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [3,1,5,8]
    **Output:** 167
    **Explanation:**
    nums = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] --> [3,8] --> [8] --> []
    coins =  3*1*5    +   3*5*8   +  1*3*8  + 1*8*1 = 167

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [1,5]
    **Output:** 10
    



**Constraints:**

  * `n == nums.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 300`
  * `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`
