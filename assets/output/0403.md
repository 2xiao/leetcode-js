# [403. Frog Jump](https://leetcode.com/problems/frog-jump/)

## 题目

A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into some number of units,
and at each unit, there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a
stone, but it must not jump into the water.

Given a list of `stones` positions (in units) in sorted **ascending order** ,
determine if the frog can cross the river by landing on the last stone.
Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assumes the first jump must be
`1` unit.

If the frog's last jump was `k` units, its next jump must be either `k - 1`,
`k`, or `k + 1` units. The frog can only jump in the forward direction.

**Example 1:**

> Input: stones = [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]
>
> Output: true
>
> Explanation: The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone, 4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.

**Example 2:**

> Input: stones = [0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]
>
> Output: false
>
> Explanation: There is no way to jump to the last stone as the gap between the 5th and 6th stone is too large.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= stones.length <= 2000`
- `0 <= stones[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- `stones[0] == 0`
- `stones` is sorted in a strictly increasing order.
