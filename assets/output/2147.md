# [2147. Number of Ways to Divide a Long Corridor](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-divide-a-long-corridor/)

## 题目

Along a long library corridor, there is a line of seats and decorative plants.
You are given a **0-indexed** string `corridor` of length `n` consisting of
letters `'S'` and `'P'` where each `'S'` represents a seat and each `'P'`
represents a plant.

One room divider has **already** been installed to the left of index `0`, and
**another** to the right of index `n - 1`. Additional room dividers can be
installed. For each position between indices `i - 1` and `i` (`1 <= i <= n -
1`), at most one divider can be installed.

Divide the corridor into non-overlapping sections, where each section has
**exactly two seats** with any number of plants. There may be multiple ways to
perform the division. Two ways are **different** if there is a position with a
room divider installed in the first way but not in the second way.

Return _the number of ways to divide the corridor_. Since the answer may be
very large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`. If there is no way, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: corridor = "SSPPSPS"
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: There are 3 different ways to divide the corridor.
>
> The black bars in the above image indicate the two room dividers already installed.
>
> Note that in each of the ways, **each** section has exactly **two** seats.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/04/2.png)

> Input: corridor = "PPSPSP"
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation: There is only 1 way to divide the corridor, by not installing any additional dividers.
>
> Installing any would create some section that does not have exactly two seats.

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/12/3.png)

> Input: corridor = "S"
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation: There is no way to divide the corridor because there will always be a section that does not have exactly two seats.

**Constraints:**

- `n == corridor.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `corridor[i]` is either `'S'` or `'P'`.
