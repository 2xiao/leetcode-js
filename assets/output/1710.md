# [1710. Maximum Units on a Truck](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-units-on-a-truck/)

## 题目

You are assigned to put some amount of boxes onto **one truck**. You are given
a 2D array `boxTypes`, where `boxTypes[i] = [numberOfBoxesi,
numberOfUnitsPerBoxi]`:

- `numberOfBoxesi` is the number of boxes of type `i`.
- `numberOfUnitsPerBoxi` is the number of units in each box of the type `i`.

You are also given an integer `truckSize`, which is the **maximum** number of
**boxes** that can be put on the truck. You can choose any boxes to put on the
truck as long as the number of boxes does not exceed `truckSize`.

Return _the **maximum** total number of **units** that can be put on the
truck._

**Example 1:**

> Input: boxTypes = [[1,3],[2,2],[3,1]], truckSize = 4
>
> Output: 8
>
> Explanation: There are:
>
> - 1 box of the first type that contains 3 units.
> - 2 boxes of the second type that contain 2 units each.
> - 3 boxes of the third type that contain 1 unit each.
>
> You can take all the boxes of the first and second types, and one box of the third type.
>
> The total number of units will be = (1 _ 3) + (2 _ 2) + (1 \* 1) = 8.

**Example 2:**

> Input: boxTypes = [[5,10],[2,5],[4,7],[3,9]], truckSize = 10
>
> Output: 91

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= boxTypes.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= numberOfBoxesi, numberOfUnitsPerBoxi <= 1000`
- `1 <= truckSize <= 10^6`
