# [2654. Minimum Number of Operations to Make All Array Elements Equal to 1](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-make-all-array-elements-equal-to-1)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed**  array `nums` consisiting of **positive**
integers. You can do the following operation on the array **any** number of
times:

  * Select an index `i` such that `0 <= i < n - 1` and replace either of `nums[i]` or `nums[i+1]` with their gcd value.

Return _the **minimum** number of operations to make all elements of _`nums`
_equal to_`1`. If it is impossible, return `-1`.

The gcd of two integers is the greatest common divisor of the two integers.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [2,6,3,4]
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** We can do the following operations:
    - Choose index i = 2 and replace nums[2] with gcd(3,4) = 1. Now we have nums = [2,6,1,4].
    - Choose index i = 1 and replace nums[1] with gcd(6,1) = 1. Now we have nums = [2,1,1,4].
    - Choose index i = 0 and replace nums[0] with gcd(2,1) = 1. Now we have nums = [1,1,1,4].
    - Choose index i = 2 and replace nums[3] with gcd(1,4) = 1. Now we have nums = [1,1,1,1].
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [2,10,6,14]
    **Output:** -1
    **Explanation:** It can be shown that it is impossible to make all the elements equal to 1.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= nums.length <= 50`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 106`



**Follow-up:**

The `O(n)` time complexity solution works, but could you find an `O(1)`
constant time complexity solution?
