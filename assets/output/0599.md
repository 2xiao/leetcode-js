# [599. Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-index-sum-of-two-lists)

## 题目

Given two arrays of strings `list1` and `list2`, find the **common strings
with the least index sum**.

A **common string** is a string that appeared in both `list1` and `list2`.

A **common string with the least index sum** is a common string such that if
it appeared at `list1[i]` and `list2[j]` then `i + j` should be the minimum
value among all the other **common strings**.

Return _all the **common strings with the least index sum**_. Return the
answer in **any order**.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["Piatti","The Grill at Torrey Pines","Hungry Hunter Steakhouse","Shogun"]
    **Output:** ["Shogun"]
    **Explanation:** The only common string is "Shogun".
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["KFC","Shogun","Burger King"]
    **Output:** ["Shogun"]
    **Explanation:** The common string with the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum = (0 + 1) = 1.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** list1 = ["happy","sad","good"], list2 = ["sad","happy","good"]
    **Output:** ["sad","happy"]
    **Explanation:** There are three common strings:
    "happy" with index sum = (0 + 1) = 1.
    "sad" with index sum = (1 + 0) = 1.
    "good" with index sum = (2 + 2) = 4.
    The strings with the least index sum are "sad" and "happy".
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= list1.length, list2.length <= 1000`
  * `1 <= list1[i].length, list2[i].length <= 30`
  * `list1[i]` and `list2[i]` consist of spaces `' '` and English letters.
  * All the strings of `list1` are **unique**.
  * All the strings of `list2` are **unique**.
  * There is at least a common string between `list1` and `list2`.
