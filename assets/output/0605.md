# [605. Can Place Flowers](https://leetcode.com/problems/can-place-flowers/)

## 题目

You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are
not. However, flowers cannot be planted in **adjacent** plots.

Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing `0`'s and `1`'s, where `0` means
empty and `1` means not empty, and an integer `n`, return `true`  _if_ `n`
_new flowers can be planted in the_ `flowerbed` _without violating the no-
adjacent-flowers rule and_ `false` _otherwise_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
> 
> Output: true

**Example 2:**

> Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
> 
> Output: false

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104`
  * `flowerbed[i]` is `0` or `1`.
  * There are no two adjacent flowers in `flowerbed`.
  * `0 <= n <= flowerbed.length`
