# [3025. Find the Number of Ways to Place People I](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-number-of-ways-to-place-people-i/)

## 题目

You are given a 2D array `points` of size `n x 2` representing integer
coordinates of some points on a 2D plane, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`.

Count the number of pairs of points `(A, B)`, where

- `A` is on the **upper left** side of `B`, and
- there are no other points in the rectangle (or line) they make (**including the border**).

Return the count.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

There is no way to choose `A` and `B` so `A` is on the upper left side of `B`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** points = [[6,2],[4,4],[2,6]]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

- The left one is the pair `(points[1], points[0])`, where `points[1]` is on the upper left side of `points[0]` and the rectangle is empty.
- The middle one is the pair `(points[2], points[1])`, same as the left one it is a valid pair.
- The right one is the pair `(points[2], points[0])`, where `points[2]` is on the upper left side of `points[0]`, but `points[1]` is inside the rectangle so it's not a valid pair.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** points = [[3,1],[1,3],[1,1]]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

- The left one is the pair `(points[2], points[0])`, where `points[2]` is on the upper left side of `points[0]` and there are no other points on the line they form. Note that it is a valid state when the two points form a line.
- The middle one is the pair `(points[1], points[2])`, it is a valid pair same as the left one.
- The right one is the pair `(points[1], points[0])`, it is not a valid pair as `points[2]` is on the border of the rectangle.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 50`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 50`
- All `points[i]` are distinct.
