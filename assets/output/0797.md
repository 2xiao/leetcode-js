# [797. All Paths From Source to Target](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-paths-from-source-to-target/)

## 题目

Given a directed acyclic graph ( **DAG** ) of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n

- 1`, find all possible paths from node `0`to node`n - 1` and return them in
  **any order**.

The graph is given as follows: `graph[i]` is a list of all nodes you can visit
from node `i` (i.e., there is a directed edge from node `i` to node
`graph[i][j]`).

**Example 1:**

> Input: graph = [[1,2],[3],[3],[]]
>
> Output: [[0,1,3],[0,2,3]]
>
> Explanation: There are two paths: 0 -> 1 -> 3 and 0 -> 2 -> 3.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/28/all_2.jpg)

> Input: graph = [[4,3,1],[3,2,4],[3],[4],[]]
>
> Output: [[0,4],[0,3,4],[0,1,3,4],[0,1,2,3,4],[0,1,4]]

**Constraints:**

- `n == graph.length`
- `2 <= n <= 15`
- `0 <= graph[i][j] < n`
- `graph[i][j] != i` (i.e., there will be no self-loops).
- All the elements of `graph[i]` are **unique**.
- The input graph is **guaranteed** to be a **DAG**.
