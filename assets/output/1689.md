# [1689. Partitioning Into Minimum Number Of Deci-Binary Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/partitioning-into-minimum-number-of-deci-binary-numbers/)

## 题目

A decimal number is called **deci-binary** if each of its digits is either `0`
or `1` without any leading zeros. For example, `101` and `1100` are **deci-
binary** , while `112` and `3001` are not.

Given a string `n` that represents a positive decimal integer, return _the
**minimum** number of positive **deci-binary** numbers needed so that they sum
up to _`n` _._

**Example 1:**

> Input: n = "32"
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: 10 + 11 + 11 = 32

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = "82734"
>
> Output: 8

**Example 3:**

> Input: n = "27346209830709182346"
>
> Output: 9

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n.length <= 10^5`
- `n` consists of only digits.
- `n` does not contain any leading zeros and represents a positive integer.
