# [2063. Vowels of All Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/vowels-of-all-substrings/)

## 题目

Given a string `word`, return _the **sum of the number of vowels** (_`'a'`,
`'e'` _,_ `'i'` _,_ `'o'` _, and_ `'u'` _)_ _in every substring of_`word`.

A **substring** is a contiguous (non-empty) sequence of characters within a
string.

**Note:** Due to the large constraints, the answer may not fit in a signed
32-bit integer. Please be careful during the calculations.

**Example 1:**

> Input: word = "aba"
>
> Output: 6
>
> Explanation:
>
> All possible substrings are: "a", "ab", "aba", "b", "ba", and "a".
>
> - "b" has 0 vowels in it
> - "a", "ab", "ba", and "a" have 1 vowel each
> - "aba" has 2 vowels in it
>
> Hence, the total sum of vowels = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6.

**Example 2:**

> Input: word = "abc"
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation:
>
> All possible substrings are: "a", "ab", "abc", "b", "bc", and "c".
>
> - "a", "ab", and "abc" have 1 vowel each
> - "b", "bc", and "c" have 0 vowels each
>
> Hence, the total sum of vowels = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3.

**Example 3:**

> Input: word = "ltcd"
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation: There are no vowels in any substring of "ltcd".

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= word.length <= 10^5`
- `word` consists of lowercase English letters.
