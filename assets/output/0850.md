# [850. Rectangle Area II](https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-area-ii/)

## 题目

You are given a 2D array of axis-aligned `rectangles`. Each `rectangle[i] =
[xi1, yi1, xi2, yi2]` denotes the `ith` rectangle where `(xi1, yi1)` are the
coordinates of the **bottom-left corner** , and `(xi2, yi2)` are the
coordinates of the **top-right corner**.

Calculate the **total area** covered by all `rectangles` in the plane. Any
area covered by two or more rectangles should only be counted **once**.

Return _the **total area**_. Since the answer may be too large, return it
**modulo** `109 + 7`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: rectangles = [[0,0,2,2],[1,0,2,3],[1,0,3,1]]
> 
> Output: 6
> 
> Explanation: A total area of 6 is covered by all three rectangles, as illustrated in the picture.
> 
> From (1,1) to (2,2), the green and red rectangles overlap.
> 
> From (1,0) to (2,3), all three rectangles overlap.

**Example 2:**

> Input: rectangles = [[0,0,1000000000,1000000000]]
> 
> Output: 49
> 
> Explanation: The answer is 1018 modulo (109 + 7), which is 49.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= rectangles.length <= 200`
  * `rectanges[i].length == 4`
  * `0 <= xi1, yi1, xi2, yi2 <= 109`
  * `xi1 <= xi2`
  * `yi1 <= yi2`
