# [2497. Maximum Star Sum of a Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-star-sum-of-a-graph/)

## 题目

There is an undirected graph consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n -
1`. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `vals` of length `n` where
`vals[i]` denotes the value of the `ith` node.

You are also given a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]`
denotes that there exists an **undirected** edge connecting nodes `ai` and
`bi.`

A **star graph** is a subgraph of the given graph having a center node
containing `0` or more neighbors. In other words, it is a subset of edges of
the given graph such that there exists a common node for all edges.

The image below shows star graphs with `3` and `4` neighbors respectively,
centered at the blue node.

The **star sum** is the sum of the values of all the nodes present in the star
graph.

Given an integer `k`, return _the **maximum star sum** of a star graph
containing **at most** _`k` _edges._

**Example 1:**

example1drawio.png)

> Input: vals = [1,2,3,4,10,-10,-20], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4],[3,5],[3,6]], k = 2
>
> Output: 16
>
> Explanation: The above diagram represents the input graph.
>
> The star graph with the maximum star sum is denoted by blue. It is centered at 3 and includes its neighbors 1 and 4.
>
> It can be shown it is not possible to get a star graph with a sum greater than 16.

**Example 2:**

> Input: vals = [-5], edges = [], k = 0
>
> Output: -5
>
> Explanation: There is only one possible star graph, which is node 0 itself.
>
> Hence, we return -5.

**Constraints:**

- `n == vals.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= vals[i] <= 10^4`
- ` 0 <= edges.length <= min(n * (n - 1) / 2``, 105) `
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1`
- `ai != bi`
- `0 <= k <= n - 1`
