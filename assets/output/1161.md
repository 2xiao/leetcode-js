# [1161. Maximum Level Sum of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-level-sum-of-a-binary-tree)

## 题目

Given the `root` of a binary tree, the level of its root is `1`, the level of
its children is `2`, and so on.

Return the **smallest** level `x` such that the sum of all the values of nodes
at level `x` is **maximal**.



**Example 1:**

> Input: root = [1,7,0,7,-8,null,null]
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> Level 1 sum = 1.
> 
> Level 2 sum = 7 + 0 = 7.
> 
> Level 3 sum = 7 + -8 = -1.
> 
> So we return the level with the maximum sum which is level 2.

**Example 2:**

> Input: root = [989,null,10250,98693,-89388,null,null,null,-32127]
> 
> Output: 2

**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
  * `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
