# [839. Similar String Groups](https://leetcode.com/problems/similar-string-groups)

## 题目

Two strings, `X` and `Y`, are considered similar if either they are identical
or we can make them equivalent by swapping at most two letters (in distinct
positions) within the string `X`.

For example, `"tars"` and `"rats"` are similar (swapping at positions `0` and
`2`), and `"rats"` and `"arts"` are similar, but `"star"` is not similar to
`"tars"`, `"rats"`, or `"arts"`.

Together, these form two connected groups by similarity: `{"tars", "rats",
"arts"}` and `{"star"}`.  Notice that `"tars"` and `"arts"` are in the same
group even though they are not similar.  Formally, each group is such that a
word is in the group if and only if it is similar to at least one other word
in the group.

We are given a list `strs` of strings where every string in `strs` is an
anagram of every other string in `strs`. How many groups are there?



**Example 1:**

> Input: strs = ["tars","rats","arts","star"]
> 
> Output: 2

**Example 2:**

> Input: strs = ["omv","ovm"]
> 
> Output: 1

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= strs.length <= 300`
  * `1 <= strs[i].length <= 300`
  * `strs[i]` consists of lowercase letters only.
  * All words in `strs` have the same length and are anagrams of each other.
