# [1938. Maximum Genetic Difference Query](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-genetic-difference-query)

## 题目

There is a rooted tree consisting of `n` nodes numbered `0` to `n - 1`. Each
node's number denotes its **unique genetic value** (i.e. the genetic value of
node `x` is `x`). The **genetic difference** between two genetic values is
defined as the **bitwise-** **XOR** of their values. You are given the integer
array `parents`, where `parents[i]` is the parent for node `i`. If node `x` is
the **root** of the tree, then `parents[x] == -1`.

You are also given the array `queries` where `queries[i] = [nodei, vali]`. For
each query `i`, find the **maximum genetic difference** between `vali` and
`pi`, where `pi` is the genetic value of any node that is on the path between
`nodei` and the root (including `nodei` and the root). More formally, you want
to maximize `vali XOR pi`.

Return _an array_`ans` _where_`ans[i]` _is the answer to the_`ith` _query_.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/29/c1.png)

> Input: parents = [-1,0,1,1], queries = [[0,2],[3,2],[2,5]]
> 
> Output: [2,3,7]
> 
> Explanation: The queries are processed as follows:
> - [0,2]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 0, with a difference of 2 XOR 0 = 2.
> - [3,2]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 1, with a difference of 2 XOR 1 = 3.
> - [2,5]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 2, with a difference of 5 XOR 2 = 7.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/29/c2.png)

> Input: parents = [3,7,-1,2,0,7,0,2], queries = [[4,6],[1,15],[0,5]]
> 
> Output: [6,14,7]
> 
> Explanation: The queries are processed as follows:
> - [4,6]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 0, with a difference of 6 XOR 0 = 6.
> - [1,15]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 1, with a difference of 15 XOR 1 = 14.
> - [0,5]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 2, with a difference of 5 XOR 2 = 7.

**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= parents.length <= 105`
  * `0 <= parents[i] <= parents.length - 1` for every node `i` that is **not** the root.
  * `parents[root] == -1`
  * `1 <= queries.length <= 3 * 104`
  * `0 <= nodei <= parents.length - 1`
  * `0 <= vali <= 2 * 105`
