# [2564. Substring XOR Queries](https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-xor-queries)

## 题目

You are given a **binary string** `s`, and a **2D** integer array `queries`
where `queries[i] = [firsti, secondi]`.

For the `ith` query, find the **shortest substring** of `s` whose **decimal
value** , `val`, yields `secondi` when **bitwise XORed** with `firsti`. In
other words, `val ^ firsti == secondi`.

The answer to the `ith` query is the endpoints ( **0-indexed** ) of the
substring `[lefti, righti]` or `[-1, -1]` if no such substring exists. If
there are multiple answers, choose the one with the **minimum** `lefti`.

_Return an array_ `ans` _where_ `ans[i] = [lefti, righti]` _is the answer to
the_ `ith` _query._

A **substring** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a
string.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "101101", queries = [[0,5],[1,2]]
    **Output:** [[0,2],[2,3]]
    **Explanation:** For the first query the substring in range [0,2] is **" 101"** which has a decimal value of **5** , and **5 ^ 0 = 5** , hence the answer to the first query is [0,2]. In the second query, the substring in range [2,3] is **" 11",** and has a decimal value of **3** , and **3 ^ 1 = 2**. So, [2,3] is returned for the second query. 
    
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "0101", queries = [[12,8]]
    **Output:** [[-1,-1]]
    **Explanation:** In this example there is no substring that answers the query, hence [-1,-1] is returned.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "1", queries = [[4,5]]
    **Output:** [[0,0]]
    **Explanation:** For this example, the substring in range [0,0] has a decimal value of **1** , and **1 ^ 4 = 5**. So, the answer is [0,0].
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 104`
  * `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
  * `1 <= queries.length <= 105`
  * `0 <= firsti, secondi <= 109`
