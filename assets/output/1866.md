# [1866. Number of Ways to Rearrange Sticks With K Sticks Visible](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-rearrange-sticks-with-k-sticks-visible/)

## 题目

There are `n` uniquely-sized sticks whose lengths are integers from `1` to
`n`. You want to arrange the sticks such that **exactly** `k` sticks are
**visible** from the left. A stick is **visible** from the left if there are
no **longer**  sticks to the **left** of it.

  * For example, if the sticks are arranged `[ _1_ , _3_ ,2, _5_ ,4]`, then the sticks with lengths `1`, `3`, and `5` are visible from the left.

Given `n` and `k`, return _the **number** of such arrangements_. Since the
answer may be large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 3, k = 2
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation: [ _1_ , _3_ ,2], [ _2_ , _3_ ,1], and [ _2_ ,1, _3_ ] are the only arrangements such that exactly 2 sticks are visible.
> 
> The visible sticks are underlined.

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 5, k = 5
> 
> Output: 1
> 
> Explanation: [ _1_ , _2_ , _3_ , _4_ , _5_ ] is the only arrangement such that all 5 sticks are visible.
> 
> The visible sticks are underlined.

**Example 3:**

> Input: n = 20, k = 11
> 
> Output: 647427950
> 
> Explanation: There are 647427950 (mod 109 + 7) ways to rearrange the sticks such that exactly 11 sticks are visible.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 1000`
  * `1 <= k <= n`
