# [2559. Count Vowel Strings in Ranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-vowel-strings-in-ranges)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** array of strings `words` and a 2D array of
integers `queries`.

Each query `queries[i] = [li, ri]` asks us to find the number of strings
present in the range `li` to `ri` (both **inclusive** ) of `words` that start
and end with a vowel.

Return _an array_`ans` _of size_`queries.length` _, where_`ans[i]` _is the
answer to the_`i`th _query_.

**Note** that the vowel letters are `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, and `'u'`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** words = ["aba","bcb","ece","aa","e"], queries = [[0,2],[1,4],[1,1]]
    **Output:** [2,3,0]
    **Explanation:** The strings starting and ending with a vowel are "aba", "ece", "aa" and "e".
    The answer to the query [0,2] is 2 (strings "aba" and "ece").
    to query [1,4] is 3 (strings "ece", "aa", "e").
    to query [1,1] is 0.
    We return [2,3,0].
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** words = ["a","e","i"], queries = [[0,2],[0,1],[2,2]]
    **Output:** [3,2,1]
    **Explanation:** Every string satisfies the conditions, so we return [3,2,1].



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= words.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= words[i].length <= 40`
  * `words[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters.
  * `sum(words[i].length) <= 3 * 105`
  * `1 <= queries.length <= 105`
  * `0 <= li <= ri < words.length`
