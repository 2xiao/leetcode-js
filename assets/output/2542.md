# [2542. Maximum Subsequence Score](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subsequence-score/)

## 题目

You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of equal
length `n` and a positive integer `k`. You must choose a **subsequence** of
indices from `nums1` of length `k`.

For chosen indices `i0`, `i1`, ..., `ik - 1`, your **score** is defined as:

- The sum of the selected elements from `nums1` multiplied with the **minimum** of the selected elements from `nums2`.
- It can defined simply as: `(nums1[i0] + nums1[i1] +...+ nums1[ik - 1]) * min(nums2[i0] , nums2[i1], ... ,nums2[ik - 1])`.

Return _the **maximum** possible score._

A **subsequence** of indices of an array is a set that can be derived from the
set `{0, 1, ..., n-1}` by deleting some or no elements.

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums1 = [1,3,3,2], nums2 = [2,1,3,4], k = 3
>
> Output: 12
>
> Explanation:
>
> The four possible subsequence scores are:
>
> - We choose the indices 0, 1, and 2 with score = (1+3+3) \* min(2,1,3) = 7.
> - We choose the indices 0, 1, and 3 with score = (1+3+2) \* min(2,1,4) = 6.
> - We choose the indices 0, 2, and 3 with score = (1+3+2) \* min(2,3,4) = 12.
> - We choose the indices 1, 2, and 3 with score = (3+3+2) \* min(1,3,4) = 8.
>
> Therefore, we return the max score, which is 12.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums1 = [4,2,3,1,1], nums2 = [7,5,10,9,6], k = 1
>
> Output: 30
>
> Explanation:
>
> Choosing index 2 is optimal: nums1[2] _ nums2[2] = 3 _ 10 = 30 is the maximum possible score.

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums1.length == nums2.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= k <= n`
