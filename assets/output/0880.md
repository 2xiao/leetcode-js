# [880. Decoded String at Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/decoded-string-at-index)

## 题目

You are given an encoded string `s`. To decode the string to a tape, the
encoded string is read one character at a time and the following steps are
taken:

  * If the character read is a letter, that letter is written onto the tape.
  * If the character read is a digit `d`, the entire current tape is repeatedly written `d - 1` more times in total.

Given an integer `k`, return _the_`kth` _letter ( **1-indexed)** in the
decoded string_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "leet2code3", k = 10
    **Output:** "o"
    **Explanation:** The decoded string is "leetleetcodeleetleetcodeleetleetcode".
    The 10th letter in the string is "o".
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "ha22", k = 5
    **Output:** "h"
    **Explanation:** The decoded string is "hahahaha".
    The 5th letter is "h".
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "a2345678999999999999999", k = 1
    **Output:** "a"
    **Explanation:** The decoded string is "a" repeated 8301530446056247680 times.
    The 1st letter is "a".
    



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= s.length <= 100`
  * `s` consists of lowercase English letters and digits `2` through `9`.
  * `s` starts with a letter.
  * `1 <= k <= 109`
  * It is guaranteed that `k` is less than or equal to the length of the decoded string.
  * The decoded string is guaranteed to have less than `263` letters.
