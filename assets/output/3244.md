# [3244. Shortest Distance After Road Addition Queries II](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-after-road-addition-queries-ii/)

## 题目

You are given an integer `n` and a 2D integer array `queries`.

There are `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. Initially, there is a
**unidirectional** road from city `i` to city `i + 1` for all `0 <= i < n -
1`.

`queries[i] = [ui, vi]` represents the addition of a new **unidirectional**
road from city `ui` to city `vi`. After each query, you need to find the
**length** of the **shortest path** from city `0` to city `n - 1`.

There are no two queries such that `queries[i][0] < queries[j][0] <
queries[i][1] < queries[j][1]`.

Return an array `answer` where for each `i` in the range `[0, queries.length -
1]`, `answer[i]` is the _length of the shortest path_ from city `0` to city `n

- 1` after processing the **first**`i + 1` queries.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5, queries = [[2,4],[0,2],[0,4]]

**Output:** [3,2,1]

**Explanation:**

After the addition of the road from 2 to 4, the length of the shortest path
from 0 to 4 is 3.

After the addition of the road from 0 to 2, the length of the shortest path
from 0 to 4 is 2.

After the addition of the road from 0 to 4, the length of the shortest path
from 0 to 4 is 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 4, queries = [[0,3],[0,2]]

**Output:** [1,1]

**Explanation:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/06/28/image11.jpg)

After the addition of the road from 0 to 3, the length of the shortest path
from 0 to 3 is 1.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/06/28/image12.jpg)

After the addition of the road from 0 to 2, the length of the shortest path
remains 1.

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`
- `queries[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= queries[i][0] < queries[i][1] < n`
- `1 < queries[i][1] - queries[i][0]`
- There are no repeated roads among the queries.
- There are no two queries such that `i != j` and `queries[i][0] < queries[j][0] < queries[i][1] < queries[j][1]`.
