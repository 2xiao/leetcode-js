# [1089. Duplicate Zeros](https://leetcode.com/problems/duplicate-zeros/)

## 题目

Given a fixed-length integer array `arr`, duplicate each occurrence of zero,
shifting the remaining elements to the right.

**Note** that elements beyond the length of the original array are not
written. Do the above modifications to the input array in place and do not
return anything.



**Example 1:**

> Input: arr = [1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0]
> 
> Output: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
> 
> Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]

**Example 2:**

> Input: arr = [1,2,3]
> 
> Output: [1,2,3]
> 
> Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,2,3]

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= arr.length <= 104`
  * `0 <= arr[i] <= 9`
