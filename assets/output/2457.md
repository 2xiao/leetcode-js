# [2457. Minimum Addition to Make Integer Beautiful](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-addition-to-make-integer-beautiful)

## 题目

You are given two positive integers `n` and `target`.

An integer is considered **beautiful** if the sum of its digits is less than
or equal to `target`.

Return the _minimum **non-negative** integer _`x` _such that_`n + x` _is
beautiful_. The input will be generated such that it is always possible to
make `n` beautiful.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 16, target = 6
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** Initially n is 16 and its digit sum is 1 + 6 = 7. After adding 4, n becomes 20 and digit sum becomes 2 + 0 = 2. It can be shown that we can not make n beautiful with adding non-negative integer less than 4.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 467, target = 6
    **Output:** 33
    **Explanation:** Initially n is 467 and its digit sum is 4 + 6 + 7 = 17. After adding 33, n becomes 500 and digit sum becomes 5 + 0 + 0 = 5. It can be shown that we can not make n beautiful with adding non-negative integer less than 33.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 1, target = 1
    **Output:** 0
    **Explanation:** Initially n is 1 and its digit sum is 1, which is already smaller than or equal to target.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 1012`
  * `1 <= target <= 150`
  * The input will be generated such that it is always possible to make `n` beautiful.
