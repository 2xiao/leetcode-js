# [3030. Find the Grid of Region Average](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-grid-of-region-average/)

## 题目

You are given `m x n` grid `image` which represents a grayscale image, where
`image[i][j]` represents a pixel with intensity in the range `[0..255]`. You
are also given a **non-negative** integer `threshold`.

Two pixels are **adjacent** if they share an edge.

A **region** is a `3 x 3` subgrid where the **absolute difference** in
intensity between any two **adjacent** pixels is **less than or equal to**
`threshold`.

All pixels in a region belong to that region, note that a pixel can belong to
**multiple** regions.

You need to calculate a `m x n` grid `result`, where `result[i][j]` is the
**average** intensity of the regions to which `image[i][j]` belongs, **rounded
down** to the nearest integer. If `image[i][j]` belongs to multiple regions,
`result[i][j]` is the **average** of the**rounded-down average** intensities
of these regions, **rounded down** to the nearest integer. If `image[i][j]`
does**not** belong to any region, `result[i][j]` is **equal to**
`image[i][j]`.

Return the grid `result`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** image = [[5,6,7,10],[8,9,10,10],[11,12,13,10]], threshold = 3

**Output:** [[9,9,9,9],[9,9,9,9],[9,9,9,9]]

**Explanation:**

There are two regions as illustrated above. The average intensity of the first
region is 9, while the average intensity of the second region is 9.67 which is
rounded down to 9. The average intensity of both of the regions is (9 + 9) / 2
= 9. As all the pixels belong to either region 1, region 2, or both of them,
the intensity of every pixel in the result is 9.

Please note that the rounded-down values are used when calculating the average
of multiple regions, hence the calculation is done using 9 as the average
intensity of region 2, not 9.67.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** image = [[10,20,30],[15,25,35],[20,30,40],[25,35,45]], threshold =
12

**Output:** [[25,25,25],[27,27,27],[27,27,27],[30,30,30]]

**Explanation:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/12/21/example1corrected.png)

There are two regions as illustrated above. The average intensity of the first
region is 25, while the average intensity of the second region is 30. The
average intensity of both of the regions is (25 + 30) / 2 = 27.5 which is
rounded down to 27.

All the pixels in row 0 of the image belong to region 1, hence all the pixels
in row 0 in the result are 25. Similarly, all the pixels in row 3 in the
result are 30. The pixels in rows 1 and 2 of the image belong to region 1 and
region 2, hence their assigned value is 27 in the result.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** image = [[5,6,7],[8,9,10],[11,12,13]], threshold = 1

**Output:** [[5,6,7],[8,9,10],[11,12,13]]

**Explanation:**

There is only one `3 x 3` subgrid, while it does not have the condition on
difference of adjacent pixels, for example, the difference between
`image[0][0]` and `image[1][0]` is `|5 - 8| = 3 > threshold = 1`. None of them
belong to any valid regions, so the `result` should be the same as `image`.

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= n, m <= 500`
- `0 <= image[i][j] <= 255`
- `0 <= threshold <= 255`
