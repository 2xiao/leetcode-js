# [667. Beautiful Arrangement II](https://leetcode.com/problems/beautiful-arrangement-ii)

## 题目

Given two integers `n` and `k`, construct a list `answer` that contains `n`
different positive integers ranging from `1` to `n` and obeys the following
requirement:

  * Suppose this list is `answer = [a1, a2, a3, ... , an]`, then the list `[|a1 - a2|, |a2 - a3|, |a3 - a4|, ... , |an-1 - an|]` has exactly `k` distinct integers.

Return _the list_ `answer`. If there multiple valid answers, return **any of
them**.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 3, k = 1
    **Output:** [1,2,3]
    Explanation: The [1,2,3] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [1,1] has exactly 1 distinct integer: 1
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 3, k = 2
    **Output:** [1,3,2]
    Explanation: The [1,3,2] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [2,1] has exactly 2 distinct integers: 1 and 2.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= k < n <= 104`
