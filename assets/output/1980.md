# [1980. Find Unique Binary String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-unique-binary-string)

## 题目

Given an array of strings `nums` containing `n` **unique** binary strings each
of length `n`, return _a binary string of length_`n` _that **does not appear**
in _`nums` _. If there are multiple answers, you may return **any** of them_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = ["01","10"]
    **Output:** "11"
    **Explanation:** "11" does not appear in nums. "00" would also be correct.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = ["00","01"]
    **Output:** "11"
    **Explanation:** "11" does not appear in nums. "10" would also be correct.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = ["111","011","001"]
    **Output:** "101"
    **Explanation:** "101" does not appear in nums. "000", "010", "100", and "110" would also be correct.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `n == nums.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 16`
  * `nums[i].length == n`
  * `nums[i] `is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
  * All the strings of `nums` are **unique**.
