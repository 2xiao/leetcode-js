# [451. Sort Characters By Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/)

## 题目

Given a string `s`, sort it in **decreasing order** based on the **frequency**
of the characters. The **frequency** of a character is the number of times it
appears in the string.

Return _the sorted string_. If there are multiple answers, return _any of
them_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "tree"
> 
> Output: "eert"
> 
> Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
> 
> So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "cccaaa"
> 
> Output: "aaaccc"
> 
> Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and "aaaccc" are valid answers.
> 
> Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.

**Example 3:**

> Input: s = "Aabb"
> 
> Output: "bbAa"
> 
> Explanation: "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
> 
> Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 105`
  * `s` consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and digits.
