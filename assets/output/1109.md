# [1109. Corporate Flight Bookings](https://leetcode.com/problems/corporate-flight-bookings)

## 题目

There are `n` flights that are labeled from `1` to `n`.

You are given an array of flight bookings `bookings`, where `bookings[i] =
[firsti, lasti, seatsi]` represents a booking for flights `firsti` through
`lasti` ( **inclusive** ) with `seatsi` seats reserved for **each flight** in
the range.

Return _an array_`answer` _of length_`n` _, where_`answer[i]` _is the total
number of seats reserved for flight_`i`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** bookings = [[1,2,10],[2,3,20],[2,5,25]], n = 5
    **Output:** [10,55,45,25,25]
    **Explanation:**
    Flight labels:        1   2   3   4   5
    Booking 1 reserved:  10  10
    Booking 2 reserved:      20  20
    Booking 3 reserved:      25  25  25  25
    Total seats:         10  55  45  25  25
    Hence, answer = [10,55,45,25,25]
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** bookings = [[1,2,10],[2,2,15]], n = 2
    **Output:** [10,25]
    **Explanation:**
    Flight labels:        1   2
    Booking 1 reserved:  10  10
    Booking 2 reserved:      15
    Total seats:         10  25
    Hence, answer = [10,25]
    
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
  * `1 <= bookings.length <= 2 * 104`
  * `bookings[i].length == 3`
  * `1 <= firsti <= lasti <= n`
  * `1 <= seatsi <= 104`
