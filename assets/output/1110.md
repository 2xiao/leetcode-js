# [1110. Delete Nodes And Return Forest](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-nodes-and-return-forest/)

## 题目

Given the `root` of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value.

After deleting all nodes with a value in `to_delete`, we are left with a
forest (a disjoint union of trees).

Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest. You may return the
result in any order.

**Example 1:**

> Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]
>
> Output: [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]

**Example 2:**

> Input: root = [1,2,4,null,3], to_delete = [3]
>
> Output: [[1,2,4]]

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the given tree is at most `1000`.
- Each node has a distinct value between `1` and `1000`.
- `to_delete.length <= 1000`
- `to_delete` contains distinct values between `1` and `1000`.
