# [2901. Longest Unequal Adjacent Groups Subsequence II](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-unequal-adjacent-groups-subsequence-ii/)

## 题目

You are given an integer `n`, a **0-indexed** string array `words`, and a
**0-indexed** array `groups`, both arrays having length `n`.

The **hamming distance** between two strings of equal length is the number of
positions at which the corresponding characters are **different**.

You need to select the **longest** **subsequence** from an array of indices
`[0, 1, ..., n - 1]`, such that for the subsequence denoted as `[i0, i1, ...,
ik - 1]` having length `k`, the following holds:

- For **adjacent** indices in the subsequence, their corresponding groups are **unequal** , i.e., `groups[ij] != groups[ij + 1]`, for each `j` where `0 < j + 1 < k`.
- `words[ij]` and `words[ij + 1]` are **equal** in length, and the **hamming distance** between them is `1`, where `0 < j + 1 < k`, for all indices in the subsequence.

Return _a string array containing the words corresponding to the indices **(in
order)** in the selected subsequence_. If there are multiple answers, return
_any of them_.

A **subsequence** of an array is a new array that is formed from the original
array by deleting some (possibly none) of the elements without disturbing the
relative positions of the remaining elements.

**Note:** strings in `words` may be **unequal** in length.

**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 3, words = ["bab","dab","cab"], groups = [1,2,2]
>
> Output: ["bab","cab"]
>
> Explanation: A subsequence that can be selected is [0,2].
>
> - groups[0] != groups[2]
> - words[0].length == words[2].length, and the hamming distance between them is 1.
>
> So, a valid answer is [words[0],words[2]] = ["bab","cab"].
>
> Another subsequence that can be selected is [0,1].
>
> - groups[0] != groups[1]
> - words[0].length == words[1].length, and the hamming distance between them is 1.
>
> So, another valid answer is [words[0],words[1]] = ["bab","dab"].
>
> It can be shown that the length of the longest subsequence of indices that satisfies the conditions is 2.

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 4, words = ["a","b","c","d"], groups = [1,2,3,4]
>
> Output: ["a","b","c","d"]
>
> Explanation: We can select the subsequence [0,1,2,3].
>
> It satisfies both conditions.
>
> Hence, the answer is [words[0],words[1],words[2],words[3]] = ["a","b","c","d"].
>
> It has the longest length among all subsequences of indices that satisfy the conditions.
>
> Hence, it is the only answer.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n == words.length == groups.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
- `1 <= groups[i] <= n`
- `words` consists of **distinct** strings.
- `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
