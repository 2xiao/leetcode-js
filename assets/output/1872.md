# [1872. Stone Game VIII](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-viii/)

## 题目

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with **Alice starting first**.

There are `n` stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, while the
number of stones is **more than one** , they will do the following:

1. Choose an integer `x > 1`, and **remove** the leftmost `x` stones from the row.
2. Add the **sum** of the **removed** stones' values to the player's score.
3. Place a **new stone** , whose value is equal to that sum, on the left side of the row.

The game stops when **only** **one** stone is left in the row.

The **score difference** between Alice and Bob is `(Alice's score - Bob's
score)`. Alice's goal is to **maximize** the score difference, and Bob's goal
is the **minimize** the score difference.

Given an integer array `stones` of length `n` where `stones[i]` represents the
value of the `ith` stone **from the left** , return _the **score difference**
between Alice and Bob if they both play **optimally**._

**Example 1:**

>

> **Input:** stones = [-1,2,-3,4,-5]

> Output: 5

> Explanation:

> - Alice removes the first 4 stones, adds (-1) + 2 + (-3) + 4 = 2 to her score, and places a stone of

> value 2 on the left. stones = [2,-5].

> - Bob removes the first 2 stones, adds 2 + (-5) = -3 to his score, and places a stone of value -3 on

> the left. stones = [-3].

> The difference between their scores is 2 - (-3) = 5.

**Example 2:**

>

> **Input:** stones = [7,-6,5,10,5,-2,-6]

> Output: 13

> Explanation:

> - Alice removes all stones, adds 7 + (-6) + 5 + 10 + 5 + (-2) + (-6) = 13 to her score, and places a

> stone of value 13 on the left. stones = [13].

> The difference between their scores is 13 - 0 = 13.

**Example 3:**

> <= 10^4
>
> **Input:** stones = [-10,-12]

> Output: -22

> Explanation:

> - Alice can only make one move, which is to remove both stones. She adds (-10) + (-12) = -22 to her

> score and places a stone of value -22 on the left. stones = [-22].

> The difference between their scores is (-22) - 0 = -22.

**Constraints:**

- `n == stones.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= stones[i] <= 10^4`
