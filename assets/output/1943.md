# [1943. Describe the Painting](https://leetcode.com/problems/describe-the-painting/)

## 题目

There is a long and thin painting that can be represented by a number line.
The painting was painted with multiple overlapping segments where each segment
was painted with a **unique** color. You are given a 2D integer array
`segments`, where `segments[i] = [starti, endi, colori]` represents the
**half-closed segment** `[starti, endi)` with `colori` as the color.

The colors in the overlapping segments of the painting were **mixed** when it
was painted. When two or more colors mix, they form a new color that can be
represented as a **set** of mixed colors.

- For example, if colors `2`, `4`, and `6` are mixed, then the resulting mixed color is `{2,4,6}`.

For the sake of simplicity, you should only output the **sum** of the elements
in the set rather than the full set.

You want to **describe** the painting with the **minimum** number of non-
overlapping **half-closed segments** of these mixed colors. These segments can
be represented by the 2D array `painting` where `painting[j] = [leftj, rightj,
mixj]` describes a **half-closed segment** `[leftj, rightj)` with the mixed
color **sum** of `mixj`.

- For example, the painting created with `segments = [[1,4,5],[1,7,7]]` can be described by `painting = [[1,4,12],[4,7,7]]` because:
  > - `[1,4)` is colored `{5,7}` (with a sum of `12`) from both the first and second segments.
  >
  > - `[4,7)` is colored `{7}` from only the second segment.

Return _the 2D array_`painting` _describing the finished painting (excluding
any parts that are **not** painted). You may return the segments in **any
order**_.

A **half-closed segment** `[a, b)` is the section of the number line between
points `a` and `b` **including** point `a` and **not including** point `b`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: segments = [[1,4,5],[4,7,7],[1,7,9]]
>
> Output: [[1,4,14],[4,7,16]]
>
> Explanation: The painting can be described as follows:
>
> - [1,4) is colored {5,9} (with a sum of 14) from the first and third segments.
> - [4,7) is colored {7,9} (with a sum of 16) from the second and third segments.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/18/2.png)

> Input: segments = [[1,7,9],[6,8,15],[8,10,7]]
>
> Output: [[1,6,9],[6,7,24],[7,8,15],[8,10,7]]
>
> Explanation: The painting can be described as follows:
>
> - [1,6) is colored 9 from the first segment.
> - [6,7) is colored {9,15} (with a sum of 24) from the first and second segments.
> - [7,8) is colored 15 from the second segment.
> - [8,10) is colored 7 from the third segment.

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/04/c1.png)

> Input: segments = [[1,4,5],[1,4,7],[4,7,1],[4,7,11]]
>
> Output: [[1,4,12],[4,7,12]]
>
> Explanation: The painting can be described as follows:
>
> - [1,4) is colored {5,7} (with a sum of 12) from the first and second segments.
> - [4,7) is colored {1,11} (with a sum of 12) from the third and fourth segments.
>
> Note that returning a single segment [1,7) is incorrect because the mixed color sets are different.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= segments.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `segments[i].length == 3`
- `1 <= starti < endi <= 10^5`
- `1 <= colori <= 10^9`
- Each `colori` is distinct.
