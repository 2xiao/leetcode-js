# [2867. Count Valid Paths in a Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-valid-paths-in-a-tree)

## 题目

There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`. You are
given the integer `n` and a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where
`edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ui` and
`vi` in the tree.

Return _the **number of valid paths** in the tree_.

A path `(a, b)` is **valid** if there exists **exactly one** prime number
among the node labels in the path from `a` to `b`.

**Note** that:

  * The path `(a, b)` is a sequence of **distinct** nodes starting with node `a` and ending with node `b` such that every two adjacent nodes in the sequence share an edge in the tree.
  * Path `(a, b)` and path `(b, a)` are considered the **same** and counted only **once**.



**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 5, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4],[2,5]]
> 
> Output: 4
> 
> Explanation: The pairs with exactly one prime number on the path between them are: 
> - (1, 2) since the path from 1 to 2 contains prime number 2. 
> - (1, 3) since the path from 1 to 3 contains prime number 3.
> - (1, 4) since the path from 1 to 4 contains prime number 2.
> - (2, 4) since the path from 2 to 4 contains prime number 2.
> 
> It can be shown that there are only 4 valid paths.

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 6, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4],[3,5],[3,6]]
> 
> Output: 6
> 
> Explanation: The pairs with exactly one prime number on the path between them are: 
> - (1, 2) since the path from 1 to 2 contains prime number 2.
> - (1, 3) since the path from 1 to 3 contains prime number 3.
> - (1, 4) since the path from 1 to 4 contains prime number 2.
> - (1, 6) since the path from 1 to 6 contains prime number 3.
> - (2, 4) since the path from 2 to 4 contains prime number 2.
> - (3, 6) since the path from 3 to 6 contains prime number 3.
> 
> It can be shown that there are only 6 valid paths.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 105`
  * `edges.length == n - 1`
  * `edges[i].length == 2`
  * `1 <= ui, vi <= n`
  * The input is generated such that `edges` represent a valid tree.
