# [2233. Maximum Product After K Increments](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-after-k-increments)

## 题目

You are given an array of non-negative integers `nums` and an integer `k`. In
one operation, you may choose **any** element from `nums` and **increment** it
by `1`.

Return _the **maximum** **product** of _`nums` _after **at most** _`k`
_operations._ Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 +
7`. Note that you should maximize the product before taking the modulo.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [0,4], k = 5
    **Output:** 20
    **Explanation:** Increment the first number 5 times.
    Now nums = [5, 4], with a product of 5 * 4 = 20.
    It can be shown that 20 is maximum product possible, so we return 20.
    Note that there may be other ways to increment nums to have the maximum product.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [6,3,3,2], k = 2
    **Output:** 216
    **Explanation:** Increment the second number 1 time and increment the fourth number 1 time.
    Now nums = [6, 4, 3, 3], with a product of 6 * 4 * 3 * 3 = 216.
    It can be shown that 216 is maximum product possible, so we return 216.
    Note that there may be other ways to increment nums to have the maximum product.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length, k <= 105`
  * `0 <= nums[i] <= 106`
