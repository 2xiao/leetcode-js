# [764. Largest Plus Sign](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-plus-sign)

## 题目

You are given an integer `n`. You have an `n x n` binary grid `grid` with all
values initially `1`'s except for some indices given in the array `mines`. The
`ith` element of the array `mines` is defined as `mines[i] = [xi, yi]` where
`grid[xi][yi] == 0`.

Return _the order of the largest **axis-aligned** plus sign of _1 _' s
contained in _`grid`. If there is none, return `0`.

An **axis-aligned plus sign** of `1`'s of order `k` has some center
`grid[r][c] == 1` along with four arms of length `k - 1` going up, down, left,
and right, and made of `1`'s. Note that there could be `0`'s or `1`'s beyond
the arms of the plus sign, only the relevant area of the plus sign is checked
for `1`'s.



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** n = 5, mines = [[4,2]]
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** In the above grid, the largest plus sign can only be of order 2. One of them is shown.
    

**Example 2:**

    **Input:** n = 1, mines = [[0,0]]
    **Output:** 0
    **Explanation:** There is no plus sign, so return 0.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 500`
  * `1 <= mines.length <= 5000`
  * `0 <= xi, yi < n`
  * All the pairs `(xi, yi)` are **unique**.
