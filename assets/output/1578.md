# [1578. Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-make-rope-colorful)

## 题目

Alice has `n` balloons arranged on a rope. You are given a **0-indexed**
string `colors` where `colors[i]` is the color of the `ith` balloon.

Alice wants the rope to be **colorful**. She does not want **two consecutive
balloons** to be of the same color, so she asks Bob for help. Bob can remove
some balloons from the rope to make it **colorful**. You are given a
**0-indexed** integer array `neededTime` where `neededTime[i]` is the time (in
seconds) that Bob needs to remove the `ith` balloon from the rope.

Return _the **minimum time** Bob needs to make the rope **colorful**_.



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** colors = "abaac", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,5]
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** In the above image, 'a' is blue, 'b' is red, and 'c' is green.
    Bob can remove the blue balloon at index 2. This takes 3 seconds.
    There are no longer two consecutive balloons of the same color. Total time = 3.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/13/balloon2.jpg)

    
    
    **Input:** colors = "abc", neededTime = [1,2,3]
    **Output:** 0
    **Explanation:** The rope is already colorful. Bob does not need to remove any balloons from the rope.
    

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/13/balloon3.jpg)

    
    
    **Input:** colors = "aabaa", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,1]
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** Bob will remove the ballons at indices 0 and 4. Each ballon takes 1 second to remove.
    There are no longer two consecutive balloons of the same color. Total time = 1 + 1 = 2.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `n == colors.length == neededTime.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 105`
  * `1 <= neededTime[i] <= 104`
  * `colors` contains only lowercase English letters.
