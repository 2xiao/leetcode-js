# [1528. Shuffle String](https://leetcode.com/problems/shuffle-string)

## 题目

You are given a string `s` and an integer array `indices` of the **same
length**. The string `s` will be shuffled such that the character at the `ith`
position moves to `indices[i]` in the shuffled string.

Return _the shuffled string_.



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
    **Output:** "leetcode"
    **Explanation:** As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "abc", indices = [0,1,2]
    **Output:** "abc"
    **Explanation:** After shuffling, each character remains in its position.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `s.length == indices.length == n`
  * `1 <= n <= 100`
  * `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
  * `0 <= indices[i] < n`
  * All values of `indices` are **unique**.
