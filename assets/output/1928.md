# [1928. Minimum Cost to Reach Destination in Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-reach-destination-in-time/)

## 题目

There is a country of `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1` where **all the
cities are connected** by bi-directional roads. The roads are represented as a
2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [xi, yi, timei]` denotes a road
between cities `xi` and `yi` that takes `timei` minutes to travel. There may
be multiple roads of differing travel times connecting the same two cities,
but no road connects a city to itself.

Each time you pass through a city, you must pay a passing fee. This is
represented as a **0-indexed** integer array `passingFees` of length `n` where
`passingFees[j]` is the amount of dollars you must pay when you pass through
city `j`.

In the beginning, you are at city `0` and want to reach city `n - 1` in
`maxTime` **minutes or less**. The **cost** of your journey is the **summation
of passing fees** for each city that you passed through at some moment of your
journey ( **including** the source and destination cities).

Given `maxTime`, `edges`, and `passingFees`, return _the **minimum cost** to
complete your journey, or _`-1` _if you cannot complete it within_`maxTime`
_minutes_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/04/leetgraph1-1.png)

> Input: maxTime = 30, edges = [[0,1,10],[1,2,10],[2,5,10],[0,3,1],[3,4,10],[4,5,15]], passingFees = [5,1,2,20,20,3]
>
> Output: 11
>
> Explanation: The path to take is 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5, which takes 30 minutes and has $11 worth of passing fees.

**Example 2:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/04/copy-of-
leetgraph1-1.png)**

> Input: maxTime = 29, edges = [[0,1,10],[1,2,10],[2,5,10],[0,3,1],[3,4,10],[4,5,15]], passingFees = [5,1,2,20,20,3]
>
> Output: 48
>
> Explanation: The path to take is 0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, which takes 26 minutes and has $48 worth of passing fees.
>
> You cannot take path 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5 since it would take too long.

**Example 3:**

> Input: maxTime = 25, edges = [[0,1,10],[1,2,10],[2,5,10],[0,3,1],[3,4,10],[4,5,15]], passingFees = [5,1,2,20,20,3]
>
> Output: -1
>
> Explanation: There is no way to reach city 5 from city 0 within 25 minutes.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= maxTime <= 1000`
- `n == passingFees.length`
- `2 <= n <= 1000`
- `n - 1 <= edges.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= xi, yi <= n - 1`
- `1 <= timei <= 1000`
- `1 <= passingFees[j] <= 1000`
- The graph may contain multiple edges between two nodes.
- The graph does not contain self loops.
