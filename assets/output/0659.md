# [659. Split Array into Consecutive Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-into-consecutive-subsequences/)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `nums` that is **sorted in non-decreasing
order**.

Determine if it is possible to split `nums` into **one or more subsequences**
such that **both** of the following conditions are true:

- Each subsequence is a **consecutive increasing sequence** (i.e. each integer is **exactly one** more than the previous integer).
- All subsequences have a length of `3` **or more**.

Return `true` _if you can split_`nums` _according to the above conditions,
or_`false` _otherwise_.

A **subsequence** of an array is a new array that is formed from the original
array by deleting some (can be none) of the elements without disturbing the
relative positions of the remaining elements. (i.e., `[1,3,5]` is a
subsequence of `[ _1_ ,2, _3_ ,4, _5_ ]` while `[1,3,2]` is not).

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [1,2,3,3,4,5]
>
> Output: true
>
> Explanation: nums can be split into the following subsequences:
>
> [ ** _1_** , ** _2_** , ** _3_** ,3,4,5] --> 1, 2, 3
>
> [1,2,3, ** _3_** , ** _4_** , ** _5_** ] --> 3, 4, 5

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]
>
> Output: true
>
> Explanation: nums can be split into the following subsequences:
>
> [ ** _1_** , ** _2_** , ** _3_** ,3, ** _4_** ,4, ** _5_** ,5] --> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
>
> [1,2,3, ** _3_** ,4, ** _4_** ,5, ** _5_** ] --> 3, 4, 5

**Example 3:**

> Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4,5]
>
> Output: false
>
> Explanation: It is impossible to split nums into consecutive increasing subsequences of length 3 or more.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.
