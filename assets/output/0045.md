# [45. Jump Game II](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** array of integers `nums` of length `n`. You are
initially positioned at `nums[0]`.

Each element `nums[i]` represents the maximum length of a forward jump from
index `i`. In other words, if you are at `nums[i]`, you can jump to any
`nums[i + j]` where:

  * `0 <= j <= nums[i]` and
  * `i + j < n`

Return _the minimum number of jumps to reach_`nums[n - 1]`. The test cases are
generated such that you can reach `nums[n - 1]`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [2,3,0,1,4]
    **Output:** 2
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
  * `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
  * It's guaranteed that you can reach `nums[n - 1]`.
