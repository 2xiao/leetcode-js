# [2379. Minimum Recolors to Get K Consecutive Black Blocks](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-recolors-to-get-k-consecutive-black-blocks/)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** string `blocks` of length `n`, where `blocks[i]`
is either `'W'` or `'B'`, representing the color of the `ith` block. The
characters `'W'` and `'B'` denote the colors white and black, respectively.

You are also given an integer `k`, which is the desired number of
**consecutive** black blocks.

In one operation, you can **recolor** a white block such that it becomes a
black block.

Return _the **minimum** number of operations needed such that there is at
least **one** occurrence of _`k` _consecutive black blocks._



**Example 1:**

> Input: blocks = "WBBWWBBWBW", k = 7
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> One way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks is to recolor the 0th, 3rd, and 4th blocks
> 
> so that blocks = "BBBBBBBWBW". 
> 
> It can be shown that there is no way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks in less than 3 operations.
> 
> Therefore, we return 3.

**Example 2:**

> Input: blocks = "WBWBBBW", k = 2
> 
> Output: 0
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> No changes need to be made, since 2 consecutive black blocks already exist.
> 
> Therefore, we return 0.

**Constraints:**

  * `n == blocks.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 100`
  * `blocks[i]` is either `'W'` or `'B'`.
  * `1 <= k <= n`
