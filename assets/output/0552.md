# [552. Student Attendance Record II](https://leetcode.com/problems/student-attendance-record-ii/)

## 题目

An attendance record for a student can be represented as a string where each
character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that
day. The record only contains the following three characters:

- `'A'`: Absent.
- `'L'`: Late.
- `'P'`: Present.

Any student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet **both** of the
following criteria:

- The student was absent (`'A'`) for **strictly** fewer than 2 days **total**.
- The student was **never** late (`'L'`) for 3 or more **consecutive** days.

Given an integer `n`, return _the **number** of possible attendance records of
length_ `n` _that make a student eligible for an attendance award. The answer
may be very large, so return it **modulo** _`10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 2
>
> Output: 8
>
> Explanation: There are 8 records with length 2 that are eligible for an award:
>
> "PP", "AP", "PA", "LP", "PL", "AL", "LA", "LL"
>
> Only "AA" is not eligible because there are 2 absences (there need to be fewer than 2).

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 1
>
> Output: 3

**Example 3:**

> Input: n = 10101
>
> Output: 183236316

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
