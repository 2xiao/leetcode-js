# [420. Strong Password Checker](https://leetcode.com/problems/strong-password-checker)

## 题目

A password is considered strong if the below conditions are all met:

  * It has at least `6` characters and at most `20` characters.
  * It contains at least **one lowercase** letter, at least **one uppercase** letter, and at least **one digit**.
  * It does not contain three repeating characters in a row (i.e., `"B _ **aaa**_ bb0"` is weak, but `"B ** _aa_** b _ **a**_ 0"` is strong).

Given a string `password`, return _the minimum number of steps required to
make`password` strong. if `password` is already strong, return `0`._

In one step, you can:

  * Insert one character to `password`,
  * Delete one character from `password`, or
  * Replace one character of `password` with another character.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** password = "a"
    **Output:** 5
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** password = "aA1"
    **Output:** 3
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** password = "1337C0d3"
    **Output:** 0
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= password.length <= 50`
  * `password` consists of letters, digits, dot `'.'` or exclamation mark `'!'`.
