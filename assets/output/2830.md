# [2830. Maximize the Profit as the Salesman](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-the-profit-as-the-salesman/)

## 题目

You are given an integer `n` representing the number of houses on a number
line, numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.

Additionally, you are given a 2D integer array `offers` where `offers[i] =
[starti, endi, goldi]`, indicating that `ith` buyer wants to buy all the
houses from `starti` to `endi` for `goldi` amount of gold.

As a salesman, your goal is to **maximize** your earnings by strategically
selecting and selling houses to buyers.

Return _the maximum amount of gold you can earn_.

**Note** that different buyers can't buy the same house, and some houses may
remain unsold.



**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 5, offers = [[0,0,1],[0,2,2],[1,3,2]]
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation: There are 5 houses numbered from 0 to 4 and there are 3 purchase offers.
> 
> We sell houses in the range [0,0] to 1st buyer for 1 gold and houses in the range [1,3] to 3rd buyer for 2 golds.
> 
> It can be proven that 3 is the maximum amount of gold we can achieve.

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 5, offers = [[0,0,1],[0,2,10],[1,3,2]]
> 
> Output: 10
> 
> Explanation: There are 5 houses numbered from 0 to 4 and there are 3 purchase offers.
> 
> We sell houses in the range [0,2] to 2nd buyer for 10 golds.
> 
> It can be proven that 10 is the maximum amount of gold we can achieve.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 105`
  * `1 <= offers.length <= 105`
  * `offers[i].length == 3`
  * `0 <= starti <= endi <= n - 1`
  * `1 <= goldi <= 103`
