# [2065. Maximum Path Quality of a Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-path-quality-of-a-graph)

## 题目

There is an **undirected** graph with `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` (
**inclusive** ). You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `values` where
`values[i]` is the **value** of the `ith` node. You are also given a
**0-indexed** 2D integer array `edges`, where each `edges[j] = [uj, vj,
timej]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between the nodes `uj` and
`vj`, and it takes `timej` seconds to travel between the two nodes. Finally,
you are given an integer `maxTime`.

A **valid** **path** in the graph is any path that starts at node `0`, ends at
node `0`, and takes **at most** `maxTime` seconds to complete. You may visit
the same node multiple times. The **quality** of a valid path is the **sum**
of the values of the **unique nodes** visited in the path (each node's value
is added **at most once** to the sum).

Return _the **maximum** quality of a valid path_.

**Note:** There are **at most four** edges connected to each node.



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** values = [0,32,10,43], edges = [[0,1,10],[1,2,15],[0,3,10]], maxTime = 49
    **Output:** 75
    **Explanation:**
    One possible path is 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 3 -> 0. The total time taken is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 <= 49.
    The nodes visited are 0, 1, and 3, giving a maximal path quality of 0 + 32 + 43 = 75.
    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/19/ex2drawio.png)

    
    
    **Input:** values = [5,10,15,20], edges = [[0,1,10],[1,2,10],[0,3,10]], maxTime = 30
    **Output:** 25
    **Explanation:**
    One possible path is 0 -> 3 -> 0. The total time taken is 10 + 10 = 20 <= 30.
    The nodes visited are 0 and 3, giving a maximal path quality of 5 + 20 = 25.
    

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/19/ex31drawio.png)

    
    
    **Input:** values = [1,2,3,4], edges = [[0,1,10],[1,2,11],[2,3,12],[1,3,13]], maxTime = 50
    **Output:** 7
    **Explanation:**
    One possible path is 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> 0. The total time taken is 10 + 13 + 13 + 10 = 46 <= 50.
    The nodes visited are 0, 1, and 3, giving a maximal path quality of 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `n == values.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 1000`
  * `0 <= values[i] <= 108`
  * `0 <= edges.length <= 2000`
  * `edges[j].length == 3 `
  * `0 <= uj < vj <= n - 1`
  * `10 <= timej, maxTime <= 100`
  * All the pairs `[uj, vj]` are **unique**.
  * There are **at most four** edges connected to each node.
  * The graph may not be connected.
