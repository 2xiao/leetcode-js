# [1502. Can Make Arithmetic Progression From Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/can-make-arithmetic-progression-from-sequence)

## 题目

A sequence of numbers is called an **arithmetic progression** if the
difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

Given an array of numbers `arr`, return `true` _if the array can be rearranged
to form an **arithmetic progression**. Otherwise, return_ `false`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** arr = [3,5,1]
    **Output:** true
    **Explanation:** We can reorder the elements as [1,3,5] or [5,3,1] with differences 2 and -2 respectively, between each consecutive elements.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** arr = [1,2,4]
    **Output:** false
    **Explanation:** There is no way to reorder the elements to obtain an arithmetic progression.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= arr.length <= 1000`
  * `-106 <= arr[i] <= 106`
