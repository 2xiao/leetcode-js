# [2312. Selling Pieces of Wood](https://leetcode.com/problems/selling-pieces-of-wood)

## 题目

You are given two integers `m` and `n` that represent the height and width of
a rectangular piece of wood. You are also given a 2D integer array `prices`,
where `prices[i] = [hi, wi, pricei]` indicates you can sell a rectangular
piece of wood of height `hi` and width `wi` for `pricei` dollars.

To cut a piece of wood, you must make a vertical or horizontal cut across the
**entire** height or width of the piece to split it into two smaller pieces.
After cutting a piece of wood into some number of smaller pieces, you can sell
pieces according to `prices`. You may sell multiple pieces of the same shape,
and you do not have to sell all the shapes. The grain of the wood makes a
difference, so you **cannot** rotate a piece to swap its height and width.

Return _the **maximum** money you can earn after cutting an _`m x n` _piece of
wood_.

Note that you can cut the piece of wood as many times as you want.



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** m = 3, n = 5, prices = [[1,4,2],[2,2,7],[2,1,3]]
    **Output:** 19
    **Explanation:** The diagram above shows a possible scenario. It consists of:
    - 2 pieces of wood shaped 2 x 2, selling for a price of 2 * 7 = 14.
    - 1 piece of wood shaped 2 x 1, selling for a price of 1 * 3 = 3.
    - 1 piece of wood shaped 1 x 4, selling for a price of 1 * 2 = 2.
    This obtains a total of 14 + 3 + 2 = 19 money earned.
    It can be shown that 19 is the maximum amount of money that can be earned.
    

**Example 2:**

    **Input:** m = 4, n = 6, prices = [[3,2,10],[1,4,2],[4,1,3]]
    **Output:** 32
    **Explanation:** The diagram above shows a possible scenario. It consists of:
    - 3 pieces of wood shaped 3 x 2, selling for a price of 3 * 10 = 30.
    - 1 piece of wood shaped 1 x 4, selling for a price of 1 * 2 = 2.
    This obtains a total of 30 + 2 = 32 money earned.
    It can be shown that 32 is the maximum amount of money that can be earned.
    Notice that we cannot rotate the 1 x 4 piece of wood to obtain a 4 x 1 piece of wood.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= m, n <= 200`
  * `1 <= prices.length <= 2 * 104`
  * `prices[i].length == 3`
  * `1 <= hi <= m`
  * `1 <= wi <= n`
  * `1 <= pricei <= 106`
  * All the shapes of wood `(hi, wi)` are pairwise **distinct**.
