# [2715. Timeout Cancellation](https://leetcode.com/problems/timeout-cancellation/)

## 题目

Given a function `fn`, an array of arguments `args`, and a timeout `t` in
milliseconds, return a cancel function `cancelFn`.

After a delay of `t`, `fn` should be called with `args` passed as parameters
**unless** `cancelFn` was invoked before the delay of `t` milliseconds
elapses, specifically at `cancelT` ms. In that case, `fn` should never be
called.

**Example 1:**

> Input: fn = (x) => x \* 5, args = [2], t = 20, cancelT = 50
>
> Output: [{"time": 20, "returned": 10}]
>
> Explanation:
>
> const result = []
>
> const fn = (x) => x \* 5
>
> const start = performance.now()
>
> const log = (...argsArr) => {
>
> > const diff = Math.floor(performance.now() - start);
>
> > result.push({"time": diff, "returned": fn(...argsArr)})
>
> }
>
> >
>
> const cancel = cancellable(log, [2], 20);
>
> const maxT = Math.max(t, 50)
>
> >
>
> setTimeout(cancel, cancelT)
>
> setTimeout(() => {
>
> > console.log(result) // [{"time":20,"returned":10}]
>
> }, 65)
>
> The cancellation was scheduled to occur after a delay of cancelT (50ms), which happened after the execution of fn(2) at 20ms.

**Example 2:**

> Input: fn = (x) => x\*\*2, args = [2], t = 100, cancelT = 50
>
> Output: []
>
> Explanation: The cancellation was scheduled to occur after a delay of cancelT (50ms), which happened before the execution of fn(2) at 100ms, resulting in fn(2) never being called.

**Example 3:**

> Input: fn = (x1, x2) => x1 \* x2, args = [2,4], t = 30, cancelT = 100
>
> Output: [{"time": 30, "returned": 8}]
>
> Explanation: The cancellation was scheduled to occur after a delay of cancelT (100ms), which happened after the execution of fn(2,4) at 30ms.

**Constraints:**

- `fn` is a function
- `args` is a valid JSON array
- `1 <= args.length <= 10`
- `20 <= t <= 1000`
- `10 <= cancelT <= 1000`
