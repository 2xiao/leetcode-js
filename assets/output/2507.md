# [2507. Smallest Value After Replacing With Sum of Prime Factors](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-value-after-replacing-with-sum-of-prime-factors/)

## 题目

You are given a positive integer `n`.

Continuously replace `n` with the sum of its **prime factors**.

  * Note that if a prime factor divides `n` multiple times, it should be included in the sum as many times as it divides `n`.

Return _the smallest value_`n` _will take on._



**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 15
> 
> Output: 5
> 
> Explanation: Initially, n = 15.
> 
> 15 = 3 * 5, so replace n with 3 + 5 = 8.
> 
> 8 = 2 * 2 * 2, so replace n with 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
> 
> 6 = 2 * 3, so replace n with 2 + 3 = 5.
> 
> 5 is the smallest value n will take on.

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 3
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation: Initially, n = 3.
> 
> 3 is the smallest value n will take on.

**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= n <= 105`
