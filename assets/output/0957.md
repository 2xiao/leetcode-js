# [957. Prison Cells After N Days](https://leetcode.com/problems/prison-cells-after-n-days/)

## 题目

There are `8` prison cells in a row and each cell is either occupied or
vacant.

Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the
following rules:

- If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied.
- Otherwise, it becomes vacant.

**Note** that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the
row can't have two adjacent neighbors.

You are given an integer array `cells` where `cells[i] == 1` if the `ith` cell
is occupied and `cells[i] == 0` if the `ith` cell is vacant, and you are given
an integer `n`.

Return the state of the prison after `n` days (i.e., `n` such changes
described above).

**Example 1:**

> Input: cells = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1], n = 7
>
> Output: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
>
> Explanation: The following table summarizes the state of the prison on each day:
>
> Day 0: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
>
> Day 1: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
>
> Day 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
>
> Day 3: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
>
> Day 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
>
> Day 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
>
> Day 6: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
>
> Day 7: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

**Example 2:**

> Input: cells = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0], n = 1000000000
>
> Output: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]

**Constraints:**

- `cells.length == 8`
- `cells[i]` is either `0` or `1`.
- `1 <= n <= 10^9`
