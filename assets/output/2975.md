# [2975. Maximum Square Area by Removing Fences From a Field](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-square-area-by-removing-fences-from-a-field/)

## 题目

There is a large `(m - 1) x (n - 1)` rectangular field with corners at `(1,
1)` and `(m, n)` containing some horizontal and vertical fences given in
arrays `hFences` and `vFences` respectively.

Horizontal fences are from the coordinates `(hFences[i], 1)` to `(hFences[i],
n)` and vertical fences are from the coordinates `(1, vFences[i])` to `(m,
vFences[i])`.

Return _the**maximum** area of a **square** field that can be formed by
**removing** some fences (**possibly none**) or _`-1` _if it is impossible to
make a square field_.

Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

**Note:** The field is surrounded by two horizontal fences from the
coordinates `(1, 1)` to `(1, n)` and `(m, 1)` to `(m, n)` and two vertical
fences from the coordinates `(1, 1)` to `(m, 1)` and `(1, n)` to `(m, n)`.
These fences **cannot** be removed.

**Example 1:**

from-2023-11-05-22-40-25.png)

> Input: m = 4, n = 3, hFences = [2,3], vFences = [2]
>
> Output: 4
>
> Explanation: Removing the horizontal fence at 2 and the vertical fence at 2 will give a square field of area 4.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/11/22/maxsquareareaexample1.png)

> Input: m = 6, n = 7, hFences = [2], vFences = [4]
>
> Output: -1
>
> Explanation: It can be proved that there is no way to create a square field by removing fences.

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= m, n <= 10^9`
- `1 <= hFences.length, vFences.length <= 600`
- `1 < hFences[i] < m`
- `1 < vFences[i] < n`
- `hFences` and `vFences` are unique.
