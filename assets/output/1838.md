# [1838. Frequency of the Most Frequent Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/frequency-of-the-most-frequent-element/)

## 题目

The **frequency** of an element is the number of times it occurs in an array.

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. In one operation,
you can choose an index of `nums` and increment the element at that index by
`1`.

Return _the **maximum possible frequency** of an element after performing **at
most** _`k` _operations_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [1,2,4], k = 5
>
> Output: 3 **Explanation:** Increment the first element three times and the second element two times to make nums = [4,4,4].
>
> 4 has a frequency of 3.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [1,4,8,13], k = 5
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: There are multiple optimal solutions:
>
> - Increment the first element three times to make nums = [4,4,8,13]. 4 has a frequency of 2.
> - Increment the second element four times to make nums = [1,8,8,13]. 8 has a frequency of 2.
> - Increment the third element five times to make nums = [1,4,13,13]. 13 has a frequency of 2.

**Example 3:**

> Input: nums = [3,9,6], k = 2
>
> Output: 1

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= k <= 10^5`
