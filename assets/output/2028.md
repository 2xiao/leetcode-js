# [2028. Find Missing Observations](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-missing-observations)

## 题目

You have observations of `n + m` **6-sided** dice rolls with each face
numbered from `1` to `6`. `n` of the observations went missing, and you only
have the observations of `m` rolls. Fortunately, you have also calculated the
**average value** of the `n + m` rolls.

You are given an integer array `rolls` of length `m` where `rolls[i]` is the
value of the `ith` observation. You are also given the two integers `mean` and
`n`.

Return _an array of length_`n` _containing the missing observations such that
the **average value** of the _`n + m` _rolls is **exactly** _`mean`. If there
are multiple valid answers, return _any of them_. If no such array exists,
return _an empty array_.

The **average value** of a set of `k` numbers is the sum of the numbers
divided by `k`.

Note that `mean` is an integer, so the sum of the `n + m` rolls should be
divisible by `n + m`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: rolls = [3,2,4,3], mean = 4, n = 2
> 
> Output: [6,6]
> 
> Explanation: The mean of all n + m rolls is (3 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 6 + 6) / 6 = 4.

**Example 2:**

> Input: rolls = [1,5,6], mean = 3, n = 4
> 
> Output: [2,3,2,2]
> 
> Explanation: The mean of all n + m rolls is (1 + 5 + 6 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2) / 7 = 3.

**Example 3:**

> Input: rolls = [1,2,3,4], mean = 6, n = 4
> 
> Output: []
> 
> Explanation: It is impossible for the mean to be 6 no matter what the 4 missing rolls are.

**Constraints:**

  * `m == rolls.length`
  * `1 <= n, m <= 105`
  * `1 <= rolls[i], mean <= 6`
