# [3068. Find the Maximum Sum of Node Values](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-maximum-sum-of-node-values/)

## 题目

There exists an **undirected** tree with `n` nodes numbered `0` to `n - 1`.
You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`,
where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ui`
and `vi` in the tree. You are also given a **positive** integer `k`, and a
**0-indexed** array of **non-negative** integers `nums` of length `n`, where
`nums[i]` represents the **value** of the node numbered `i`.

Alice wants the sum of values of tree nodes to be **maximum** , for which
Alice can perform the following operation **any** number of times (**including
zero**) on the tree:

- Choose any edge `[u, v]` connecting the nodes `u` and `v`, and update their values as follows:
  > - `nums[u] = nums[u] XOR k`
  >
  > - `nums[v] = nums[v] XOR k`

Return _the**maximum** possible **sum** of the **values** Alice can achieve by
performing the operation **any** number of times_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [1,2,1], k = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]]
>
> Output: 6
>
> Explanation: Alice can achieve the maximum sum of 6 using a single operation:
>
> - Choose the edge [0,2]. nums[0] and nums[2] become: 1 XOR 3 = 2, and the array nums becomes: [1,2,1] -> [2,2,2].
>
> The total sum of values is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
>
> It can be shown that 6 is the maximum achievable sum of values.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/01/09/screenshot-2024-01-09-220017.png)

> Input: nums = [2,3], k = 7, edges = [[0,1]]
>
> Output: 9
>
> Explanation: Alice can achieve the maximum sum of 9 using a single operation:
>
> - Choose the edge [0,1]. nums[0] becomes: 2 XOR 7 = 5 and nums[1] become: 3 XOR 7 = 4, and the array nums becomes: [2,3] -> [5,4].
>
> The total sum of values is 5 + 4 = 9.
>
> It can be shown that 9 is the maximum achievable sum of values.

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/11/09/screenshot-2023-11-10-012641.png)

> Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7], k = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5]]
>
> Output: 42
>
> Explanation: The maximum achievable sum is 42 which can be achieved by Alice performing no operations.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n == nums.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `1 <= k <= 10^9`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= edges[i][0], edges[i][1] <= n - 1`
- The input is generated such that `edges` represent a valid tree.
