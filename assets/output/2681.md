# [2681. Power of Heroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-heroes)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` representing the strength
of some heroes. The **power** of a group of heroes is defined as follows:

  * Let `i0`, `i1`, ... ,`ik` be the indices of the heroes in a group. Then, the power of this group is `max(nums[i0], nums[i1], ... ,nums[ik])2 * min(nums[i0], nums[i1], ... ,nums[ik])`.

Return _the sum of the **power** of all **non-empty** groups of heroes
possible._ Since the sum could be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [2,1,4]
    **Output:** 141
    **Explanation:** 
    1st group: [2] has power = 22 * 2 = 8.
    2nd group: [1] has power = 12 * 1 = 1. 
    3rd group: [4] has power = 42 * 4 = 64. 
    4th group: [2,1] has power = 22 * 1 = 4. 
    5th group: [2,4] has power = 42 * 2 = 32. 
    6th group: [1,4] has power = 42 * 1 = 16. 
    ​​​​​​​7th group: [2,1,4] has power = 42​​​​​​​ * 1 = 16. 
    The sum of powers of all groups is 8 + 1 + 64 + 4 + 32 + 16 + 16 = 141.
    
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [1,1,1]
    **Output:** 7
    **Explanation:** A total of 7 groups are possible, and the power of each group will be 1. Therefore, the sum of the powers of all groups is 7.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`
