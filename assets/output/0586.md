Write a solution to find the `customer_number` for the customer who has placed
**the largest number of orders**.

The test cases are generated so that **exactly one customer** will have placed
more orders than any other customer.

The result format is in the following example.



**Example 1:**

> Input: 
> 
> Orders table:
> 
> +--------------+-----------------+
> 
> | order_number | customer_number |
> 
> +--------------+-----------------+

> Explanation:

> The customer with number 3 has two orders, which is greater than either customer 1 or 2 because each of them only has one order. 
> 
> So the result is customer_number 3.

**Follow up:** What if more than one customer has the largest number of
orders, can you find all the `customer_number` in this case?
