# [2212. Maximum Points in an Archery Competition](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-points-in-an-archery-competition)

## 题目

Alice and Bob are opponents in an archery competition. The competition has set
the following rules:

  1. Alice first shoots `numArrows` arrows and then Bob shoots `numArrows` arrows.
  2. The points are then calculated as follows: 
    1. The target has integer scoring sections ranging from `0` to `11` **inclusive**.
    2. For **each** section of the target with score `k` (in between `0` to `11`), say Alice and Bob have shot `ak` and `bk` arrows on that section respectively. If `ak >= bk`, then Alice takes `k` points. If `ak < bk`, then Bob takes `k` points.
    3. However, if `ak == bk == 0`, then **nobody** takes `k` points.

  * For example, if Alice and Bob both shot `2` arrows on the section with score `11`, then Alice takes `11` points. On the other hand, if Alice shot `0` arrows on the section with score `11` and Bob shot `2` arrows on that same section, then Bob takes `11` points.

You are given the integer `numArrows` and an integer array `aliceArrows` of
size `12`, which represents the number of arrows Alice shot on each scoring
section from `0` to `11`. Now, Bob wants to **maximize** the total number of
points he can obtain.

Return _the array_`bobArrows` _which represents the number of arrows Bob shot
on **each** scoring section from _`0` _to_`11`. The sum of the values in
`bobArrows` should equal `numArrows`.

If there are multiple ways for Bob to earn the maximum total points, return
**any** one of them.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/02/24/ex1.jpg)

    
    
    **Input:** numArrows = 9, aliceArrows = [1,1,0,1,0,0,2,1,0,1,2,0]
    **Output:** [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,2,3,1]
    **Explanation:** The table above shows how the competition is scored. 
    Bob earns a total point of 4 + 5 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 47.
    It can be shown that Bob cannot obtain a score higher than 47 points.
    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/02/24/ex2new.jpg)

    
    
    **Input:** numArrows = 3, aliceArrows = [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]
    **Output:** [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0]
    **Explanation:** The table above shows how the competition is scored.
    Bob earns a total point of 8 + 9 + 10 = 27.
    It can be shown that Bob cannot obtain a score higher than 27 points.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= numArrows <= 105`
  * `aliceArrows.length == bobArrows.length == 12`
  * `0 <= aliceArrows[i], bobArrows[i] <= numArrows`
  * `sum(aliceArrows[i]) == numArrows`
