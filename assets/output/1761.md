# [1761. Minimum Degree of a Connected Trio in a Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-degree-of-a-connected-trio-in-a-graph/)

## 题目

You are given an undirected graph. You are given an integer `n` which is the
number of nodes in the graph and an array `edges`, where each `edges[i] = [ui,
vi]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between `ui` and `vi`.

A **connected trio** is a set of **three** nodes where there is an edge
between **every** pair of them.

The **degree of a connected trio** is the number of edges where one endpoint
is in the trio, and the other is not.

Return _the **minimum** degree of a connected trio in the graph, or_ `-1` _if
the graph has no connected trios._

**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 6, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[3,2],[4,1],[5,2],[3,6]]
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: There is exactly one trio, which is [1,2,3]. The edges that form its degree are bolded in the figure above.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/26/trios2.png)

> Input: n = 7, edges = [[1,3],[4,1],[4,3],[2,5],[5,6],[6,7],[7,5],[2,6]]
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation: There are exactly three trios:
>
> 1. [1,4,3] with degree 0.
>
> 2. [2,5,6] with degree 2.
>
> 3. [5,6,7] with degree 2.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 400`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= edges.length <= n * (n-1) / 2`
- `1 <= ui, vi <= n`
- `ui != vi`
- There are no repeated edges.
