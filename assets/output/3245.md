# [3245. Alternating Groups III](https://leetcode.com/problems/alternating-groups-iii/)

## 题目

There are some red and blue tiles arranged circularly. You are given an array
of integers `colors` and a 2D integers array `queries`.

The color of tile `i` is represented by `colors[i]`:

- `colors[i] == 0` means that tile `i` is **red**.
- `colors[i] == 1` means that tile `i` is **blue**.

An **alternating** group is a contiguous subset of tiles in the circle with
**alternating** colors (each tile in the group except the first and last one
has a different color from its **adjacent** tiles in the group).

You have to process queries of two types:

- `queries[i] = [1, sizei]`, determine the count of **alternating** groups with size `sizei`.
- `queries[i] = [2, indexi, colori]`, change `colors[indexi]` to `colori`.

Return an array `answer` containing the results of the queries of the first
type _in order_.

**Note** that since `colors` represents a **circle** , the **first** and the
**last** tiles are considered to be next to each other.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** colors = [0,1,1,0,1], queries = [[2,1,0],[1,4]]

**Output:** [2]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** colors = [0,0,1,0,1,1], queries = [[1,3],[2,3,0],[1,5]]

**Output:** [2,0]

First query:

Count of the alternating groups with size 3:

Second query: `colors` will not change.

Third query: There is no alternating group with size 5.

**Constraints:**

- `4 <= colors.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `0 <= colors[i] <= 1`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `queries[i][0] == 1` or `queries[i][0] == 2`
- For all `i` that:
  > - `queries[i][0] == 1`: `queries[i].length == 2`, `3 <= queries[i][1] <= colors.length - 1`
  >
  > - `queries[i][0] == 2`: `queries[i].length == 3`, `0 <= queries[i][1] <= colors.length - 1`, `0 <= queries[i][2] <= 1`
