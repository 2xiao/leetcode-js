# [1967. Number of Strings That Appear as Substrings in Word](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-strings-that-appear-as-substrings-in-word)

## 题目

Given an array of strings `patterns` and a string `word`, return _the
**number** of strings in _`patterns` _that exist as a **substring** in
_`word`.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** patterns = ["a","abc","bc","d"], word = "abc"
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:**
    - "a" appears as a substring in " _a_ bc".
    - "abc" appears as a substring in " _abc_ ".
    - "bc" appears as a substring in "a _bc_ ".
    - "d" does not appear as a substring in "abc".
    3 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** patterns = ["a","b","c"], word = "aaaaabbbbb"
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:**
    - "a" appears as a substring in "a _a_ aaabbbbb".
    - "b" appears as a substring in "aaaaabbbb _b_ ".
    - "c" does not appear as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
    2 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** patterns = ["a","a","a"], word = "ab"
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** Each of the patterns appears as a substring in word " _a_ b".
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= patterns.length <= 100`
  * `1 <= patterns[i].length <= 100`
  * `1 <= word.length <= 100`
  * `patterns[i]` and `word` consist of lowercase English letters.
