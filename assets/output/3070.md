# [3070. Count Submatrices with Top-Left Element and Sum Less Than k](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-submatrices-with-top-left-element-and-sum-less-than-k/)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** integer matrix `grid` and an integer `k`.

Return _the**number** of submatrices that contain the top-left element of the_
`grid`, _and have a sum less than or equal to_`k`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: grid = [[7,6,3],[6,6,1]], k = 18
>
> Output: 4
>
> Explanation: There are only 4 submatrices, shown in the image above, that contain the top-left element of grid, and have a sum less than or equal to 18.

**Example 2:**

> Input: grid = [[7,2,9],[1,5,0],[2,6,6]], k = 20
>
> Output: 6
>
> Explanation: There are only 6 submatrices, shown in the image above, that contain the top-left element of grid, and have a sum less than or equal to 20.

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length `
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= n, m <= 1000 `
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 1000`
- `1 <= k <= 10^9`
