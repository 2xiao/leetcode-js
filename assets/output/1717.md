# [1717. Maximum Score From Removing Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-from-removing-substrings/)

## 题目

You are given a string `s` and two integers `x` and `y`. You can perform two
types of operations any number of times.

  * Remove substring `"ab"` and gain `x` points. 
> 
> * For example, when removing `"ab"` from `"c _ab_ xbae"` it becomes `"cxbae"`.
  * Remove substring `"ba"` and gain `y` points. 
> 
> * For example, when removing `"ba"` from `"cabx _ba_ e"` it becomes `"cabxe"`.

Return _the maximum points you can gain after applying the above operations
on_ `s`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "cdbcbbaaabab", x = 4, y = 5
> 
> Output: 19
> 
> Explanation:
> - Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaaa _ba_ b". Now, s = "cdbcbbaaab" and 5 points are added to the score.
> - Remove the "ab" underlined in "cdbcbbaa _ab_ ". Now, s = "cdbcbbaa" and 4 points are added to the score.
> - Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcb _ba_ a". Now, s = "cdbcba" and 5 points are added to the score.
> - Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbc _ba_ ". Now, s = "cdbc" and 5 points are added to the score.
> 
> Total score = 5 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 19.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "aabbaaxybbaabb", x = 5, y = 4
> 
> Output: 20

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= x, y <= 104`
  * `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
