# [2787. Ways to Express an Integer as Sum of Powers](https://leetcode.com/problems/ways-to-express-an-integer-as-sum-of-powers)

## 题目

Given two **positive** integers `n` and `x`.

Return _the number of ways_`n` _can be expressed as the sum of the_`xth`
_power of **unique** positive integers, in other words, the number of sets of
unique integers _`[n1, n2, ..., nk]` _where_`n = n1x + n2x + ... + nkx` _._

Since the result can be very large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.

For example, if `n = 160` and `x = 3`, one way to express `n` is `n = 23 + 33
+ 53`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 10, x = 2
    **Output:** 1
    **Explanation:** We can express n as the following: n = 32 + 12 = 10.
    It can be shown that it is the only way to express 10 as the sum of the 2nd power of unique integers.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 4, x = 1
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** We can express n in the following ways:
    - n = 41 = 4.
    - n = 31 + 11 = 4.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 300`
  * `1 <= x <= 5`
