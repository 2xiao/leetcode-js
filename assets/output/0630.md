# [630. Course Schedule III](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-iii)

## 题目

There are `n` different online courses numbered from `1` to `n`. You are given
an array `courses` where `courses[i] = [durationi, lastDayi]` indicate that
the `ith` course should be taken **continuously** for `durationi` days and
must be finished before or on `lastDayi`.

You will start on the `1st` day and you cannot take two or more courses
simultaneously.

Return _the maximum number of courses that you can take_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: courses = [[100,200],[200,1300],[1000,1250],[2000,3200]]
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation: 
> 
> There are totally 4 courses, but you can take 3 courses at most:
> 
> First, take the 1st course, it costs 100 days so you will finish it on the 100th day, and ready to take the next course on the 101st day.
> 
> Second, take the 3rd course, it costs 1000 days so you will finish it on the 1100th day, and ready to take the next course on the 1101st day. 
> 
> Third, take the 2nd course, it costs 200 days so you will finish it on the 1300th day. 
> 
> The 4th course cannot be taken now, since you will finish it on the 3300th day, which exceeds the closed date.

**Example 2:**

> Input: courses = [[1,2]]
> 
> Output: 1

**Example 3:**

> Input: courses = [[3,2],[4,3]]
> 
> Output: 0

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= courses.length <= 104`
  * `1 <= durationi, lastDayi <= 104`
