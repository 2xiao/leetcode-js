# [63. Unique Paths II](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii)

## 题目

You are given an `m x n` integer array `grid`. There is a robot initially
located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to
move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot
can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as `1` or `0` respectively in `grid`. A path
that the robot takes cannot include **any** square that is an obstacle.

Return _the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach
the bottom-right corner_.

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to
`2 * 109`.



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
    There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
    1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
    2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
    

**Example 2:**

    **Input:** obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
    **Output:** 1
    



**Constraints:**

  * `m == obstacleGrid.length`
  * `n == obstacleGrid[i].length`
  * `1 <= m, n <= 100`
  * `obstacleGrid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
