# [1477. Find Two Non-overlapping Sub-arrays Each With Target Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-two-non-overlapping-sub-arrays-each-with-target-sum/)

## 题目

You are given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `target`.

You have to find **two non-overlapping sub-arrays** of `arr` each with a sum
equal `target`. There can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer
where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is **minimum**.

Return _the minimum sum of the lengths_ of the two required sub-arrays, or
return `-1` if you cannot find such two sub-arrays.



**Example 1:**

> Input: arr = [3,2,2,4,3], target = 3
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: Only two sub-arrays have sum = 3 ([3] and [3]). The sum of their lengths is 2.

**Example 2:**

> Input: arr = [7,3,4,7], target = 7
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: Although we have three non-overlapping sub-arrays of sum = 7 ([7], [3,4] and [7]), but we will choose the first and third sub-arrays as the sum of their lengths is 2.

**Example 3:**

> Input: arr = [4,3,2,6,2,3,4], target = 6
> 
> Output: -1
> 
> Explanation: We have only one sub-array of sum = 6.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= arr.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`
  * `1 <= target <= 108`
