# [743. Network Delay Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/network-delay-time)

## 题目

You are given a network of `n` nodes, labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also
given `times`, a list of travel times as directed edges `times[i] = (ui, vi,
wi)`, where `ui` is the source node, `vi` is the target node, and `wi` is the
time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

We will send a signal from a given node `k`. Return _the **minimum** time it
takes for all the_ `n` _nodes to receive the signal_. If it is impossible for
all the `n` nodes to receive the signal, return `-1`.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/05/23/931_example_1.png)

> Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2
> 
> Output: 2

**Example 2:**

> Input: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 1
> 
> Output: 1

**Example 3:**

> Input: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 2
> 
> Output: -1

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= k <= n <= 100`
  * `1 <= times.length <= 6000`
  * `times[i].length == 3`
  * `1 <= ui, vi <= n`
  * `ui != vi`
  * `0 <= wi <= 100`
  * All the pairs `(ui, vi)` are **unique**. (i.e., no multiple edges.)
