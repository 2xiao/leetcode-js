# [1223. Dice Roll Simulation](https://leetcode.com/problems/dice-roll-simulation)

## 题目

A die simulator generates a random number from `1` to `6` for each roll. You
introduced a constraint to the generator such that it cannot roll the number
`i` more than `rollMax[i]` ( **1-indexed** ) consecutive times.

Given an array of integers `rollMax` and an integer `n`, return _the number of
distinct sequences that can be obtained with exact_`n` _rolls_. Since the
answer may be too large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

Two sequences are considered different if at least one element differs from
each other.



**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 2, rollMax = [1,1,2,2,2,3]
> 
> Output: 34
> 
> Explanation: There will be 2 rolls of die, if there are no constraints on the die, there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible combinations. In this case, looking at rollMax array, the numbers 1 and 2 appear at most once consecutively, therefore sequences (1,1) and (2,2) cannot occur, so the final answer is 36-2 = 34.

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 2, rollMax = [1,1,1,1,1,1]
> 
> Output: 30

**Example 3:**

> Input: n = 3, rollMax = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
> 
> Output: 181

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 5000`
  * `rollMax.length == 6`
  * `1 <= rollMax[i] <= 15`
