# [1353. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-events-that-can-be-attended/)

## 题目

You are given an array of `events` where `events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi]`.
Every event `i` starts at `startDayi` and ends at `endDayi`.

You can attend an event `i` at any day `d` where `startTimei <= d <=
endTimei`. You can only attend one event at any time `d`.

Return _the maximum number of events you can attend_.

**Example 1:**

>
> One way to attend them all is as shown.
>
> Attend the first event on day 1.
>
> Attend the second event on day 2.
>
> Attend the third event on day 3.

**Example 2:**

> Input: events= [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,2]]
>
> Output: 4

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= events.length <= 10^5`
- `events[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= startDayi <= endDayi <= 10^5`
