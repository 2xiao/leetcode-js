# [2251. Number of Flowers in Full Bloom](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-flowers-in-full-bloom/)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `flowers`, where `flowers[i] =
[starti, endi]` means the `ith` flower will be in **full bloom** from `starti`
to `endi` ( **inclusive** ). You are also given a **0-indexed** integer array
`people` of size `n`, where `people[i]` is the time that the `ith` person will
arrive to see the flowers.

Return _an integer array_`answer` _of size_`n` _, where_`answer[i]` _is the
**number** of flowers that are in full bloom when the _`ith` _person arrives._

**Example 1:**

> Input: flowers = [[1,6],[3,7],[9,12],[4,13]], people = [2,3,7,11]
>
> Output: [1,2,2,2]
>
> Explanation: The figure above shows the times when the flowers are in full bloom and when the people arrive.
>
> For each person, we return the number of flowers in full bloom during their arrival.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/02/ex2new.jpg)

> Input: flowers = [[1,10],[3,3]], people = [3,3,2]
>
> Output: [2,2,1]
>
> Explanation: The figure above shows the times when the flowers are in full bloom and when the people arrive.
>
> For each person, we return the number of flowers in full bloom during their arrival.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= flowers.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `flowers[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= starti <= endi <= 10^9`
- `1 <= people.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `1 <= people[i] <= 10^9`
