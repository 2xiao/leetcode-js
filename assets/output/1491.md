## 题目

You are given an array of **unique** integers `salary` where `salary[i]` is
the salary of the `ith` employee.

Return _the average salary of employees excluding the minimum and maximum
salary_. Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.



**Example 1:**

> Input: salary = [4000,3000,1000,2000]
> 
> Output: 2500.00000
> 
> Explanation: Minimum salary and maximum salary are 1000 and 4000 respectively.
> 
> Average salary excluding minimum and maximum salary is (2000+3000) / 2 = 2500

**Example 2:**

> Input: salary = [1000,2000,3000]
> 
> Output: 2000.00000
> 
> Explanation: Minimum salary and maximum salary are 1000 and 3000 respectively.
> 
> Average salary excluding minimum and maximum salary is (2000) / 1 = 2000

**Constraints:**

  * `3 <= salary.length <= 100`
  * `1000 <= salary[i] <= 106`
  * All the integers of `salary` are **unique**.
