## 题目

You are given a `replacements` mapping and a `text` string that may contain
**placeholders** formatted as `%var%`, where each `var` corresponds to a key
in the `replacements` mapping. Each replacement value may itself contain **one
or more** such **placeholders**. Each **placeholder** is replaced by the value
associated with its corresponding replacement key.

Return the fully substituted `text` string which **does not** contain any
**placeholders**.



**Example 1:**

**Input:** replacements = [["A","abc"],["B","def"]], text = "%A%_%B%"

**Output:** "abc_def"

**Explanation:**

  * The mapping associates `"A"` with `"abc"` and `"B"` with `"def"`.
  * Replace `%A%` with `"abc"` and `%B%` with `"def"` in the text.
  * The final text becomes `"abc_def"`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** replacements = [["A","bce"],["B","ace"],["C","abc%B%"]], text =
"%A%_%B%_%C%"

**Output:** "bce_ace_abcace"

**Explanation:**

  * The mapping associates `"A"` with `"bce"`, `"B"` with `"ace"`, and `"C"` with `"abc%B%"`.
  * Replace `%A%` with `"bce"` and `%B%` with `"ace"` in the text.
  * Then, for `%C%`, substitute `%B%` in `"abc%B%"` with `"ace"` to obtain `"abcace"`.
  * The final text becomes `"bce_ace_abcace"`.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= replacements.length <= 10`
  * Each element of `replacements` is a two-element list `[key, value]`, where: 
> 
> * `key` is a single uppercase English letter.
> 
> * `value` is a non-empty string of at most 8 characters that may contain zero or more placeholders formatted as `%<key>%`.
  * All replacement keys are unique.
  * The `text` string is formed by concatenating all key placeholders (formatted as `%<key>%`) randomly from the replacements mapping, separated by underscores.
  * `text.length == 4 * replacements.length - 1`
  * Every placeholder in the `text` or in any replacement value corresponds to a key in the `replacements` mapping.
  * There are no cyclic dependencies between replacement keys.
