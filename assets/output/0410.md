# [410. Split Array Largest Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-largest-sum/)

## 题目

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, split `nums` into `k` non-
empty subarrays such that the largest sum of any subarray is **minimized**.

Return _the minimized largest sum of the split_.

A **subarray** is a contiguous part of the array.



**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [7,2,5,10,8], k = 2
> 
> Output: 18
> 
> Explanation: There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
> 
> The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8], where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
> 
> Output: 9
> 
> Explanation: There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
> 
> The best way is to split it into [1,2,3] and [4,5], where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 9.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
  * `0 <= nums[i] <= 106`
  * `1 <= k <= min(50, nums.length)`
