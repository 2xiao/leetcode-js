# [1275. Find Winner on a Tic Tac Toe Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-winner-on-a-tic-tac-toe-game)

## 题目

**Tic-tac-toe** is played by two players `A` and `B` on a `3 x 3` grid. The
rules of Tic-Tac-Toe are:

  * Players take turns placing characters into empty squares `' '`.
  * The first player `A` always places `'X'` characters, while the second player `B` always places `'O'` characters.
  * `'X'` and `'O'` characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones.
  * The game ends when there are **three** of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
  * The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
  * No more moves can be played if the game is over.

Given a 2D integer array `moves` where `moves[i] = [rowi, coli]` indicates
that the `ith` move will be played on `grid[rowi][coli]`. return _the winner
of the game if it exists_ (`A` or `B`). In case the game ends in a draw return
`"Draw"`. If there are still movements to play return `"Pending"`.

You can assume that `moves` is valid (i.e., it follows the rules of **Tic-Tac-
Toe** ), the grid is initially empty, and `A` will play first.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/22/xo1-grid.jpg)

    
    
    **Input:** moves = [[0,0],[2,0],[1,1],[2,1],[2,2]]
    **Output:** "A"
    **Explanation:** A wins, they always play first.
    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/22/xo2-grid.jpg)

    
    
    **Input:** moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,2],[1,0],[2,0]]
    **Output:** "B"
    **Explanation:** B wins.
    

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/22/xo3-grid.jpg)

    
    
    **Input:** moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[0,1],[0,2],[2,2]]
    **Output:** "Draw"
    **Explanation:** The game ends in a draw since there are no moves to make.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= moves.length <= 9`
  * `moves[i].length == 2`
  * `0 <= rowi, coli <= 2`
  * There are no repeated elements on `moves`.
  * `moves` follow the rules of tic tac toe.
