# [2281. Sum of Total Strength of Wizards](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-total-strength-of-wizards)

## 题目

As the ruler of a kingdom, you have an army of wizards at your command.

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `strength`, where `strength[i]`
denotes the strength of the `ith` wizard. For a **contiguous** group of
wizards (i.e. the wizards' strengths form a **subarray** of `strength`), the
**total strength** is defined as the **product** of the following two values:

  * The strength of the **weakest** wizard in the group.
  * The **total** of all the individual strengths of the wizards in the group.

Return _the **sum** of the total strengths of **all** contiguous groups of
wizards_. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

A **subarray** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of elements within an
array.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** strength = [1,3,1,2]
    **Output:** 44
    **Explanation:** The following are all the contiguous groups of wizards:
    - [1] from [ _ **1**_ ,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([1]) * sum([1]) = 1 * 1 = 1
    - [3] from [1, _ **3**_ ,1,2] has a total strength of min([3]) * sum([3]) = 3 * 3 = 9
    - [1] from [1,3, _ **1**_ ,2] has a total strength of min([1]) * sum([1]) = 1 * 1 = 1
    - [2] from [1,3,1, _ **2**_ ] has a total strength of min([2]) * sum([2]) = 2 * 2 = 4
    - [1,3] from [ _ **1,3**_ ,1,2] has a total strength of min([1,3]) * sum([1,3]) = 1 * 4 = 4
    - [3,1] from [1, _ **3,1**_ ,2] has a total strength of min([3,1]) * sum([3,1]) = 1 * 4 = 4
    - [1,2] from [1,3, _ **1,2**_ ] has a total strength of min([1,2]) * sum([1,2]) = 1 * 3 = 3
    - [1,3,1] from [ _ **1,3,1**_ ,2] has a total strength of min([1,3,1]) * sum([1,3,1]) = 1 * 5 = 5
    - [3,1,2] from [1, _ **3,1,2**_ ] has a total strength of min([3,1,2]) * sum([3,1,2]) = 1 * 6 = 6
    - [1,3,1,2] from [ _ **1,3,1,2**_ ] has a total strength of min([1,3,1,2]) * sum([1,3,1,2]) = 1 * 7 = 7
    The sum of all the total strengths is 1 + 9 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 44.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** strength = [5,4,6]
    **Output:** 213
    **Explanation:** The following are all the contiguous groups of wizards: 
    - [5] from [ _ **5**_ ,4,6] has a total strength of min([5]) * sum([5]) = 5 * 5 = 25
    - [4] from [5, _ **4**_ ,6] has a total strength of min([4]) * sum([4]) = 4 * 4 = 16
    - [6] from [5,4, _ **6**_ ] has a total strength of min([6]) * sum([6]) = 6 * 6 = 36
    - [5,4] from [ _ **5,4**_ ,6] has a total strength of min([5,4]) * sum([5,4]) = 4 * 9 = 36
    - [4,6] from [5, _ **4,6**_ ] has a total strength of min([4,6]) * sum([4,6]) = 4 * 10 = 40
    - [5,4,6] from [ _ **5,4,6**_ ] has a total strength of min([5,4,6]) * sum([5,4,6]) = 4 * 15 = 60
    The sum of all the total strengths is 25 + 16 + 36 + 36 + 40 + 60 = 213.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= strength.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= strength[i] <= 109`
