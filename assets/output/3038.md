# [3038. Maximum Number of Operations With the Same Score I](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-operations-with-the-same-score-i/)

## 题目

You are given an array of integers `nums`. Consider the following operation:

- Delete the first two elements `nums` and define the _score_ of the operation as the sum of these two elements.

You can perform this operation until `nums` contains fewer than two elements.
Additionally, the **same** _score_ must be achieved in **all** operations.

Return the **maximum** number of operations you can perform.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [3,2,1,4,5]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

- We can perform the first operation with the score `3 + 2 = 5`. After this operation, `nums = [1,4,5]`.
- We can perform the second operation as its score is `4 + 1 = 5`, the same as the previous operation. After this operation, `nums = [5]`.
- As there are fewer than two elements, we can't perform more operations.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,5,3,3,4,1,3,2,2,3]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

- We can perform the first operation with the score `1 + 5 = 6`. After this operation, `nums = [3,3,4,1,3,2,2,3]`.
- We can perform the second operation as its score is `3 + 3 = 6`, the same as the previous operation. After this operation, `nums = [4,1,3,2,2,3]`.
- We cannot perform the next operation as its score is `4 + 1 = 5`, which is different from the previous scores.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [5,3]

**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
