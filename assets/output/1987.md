# [1987. Number of Unique Good Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-unique-good-subsequences)

## 题目

You are given a binary string `binary`. A **subsequence** of `binary` is
considered **good** if it is **not empty** and has **no leading zeros** (with
the exception of `"0"`).

Find the number of **unique good subsequences** of `binary`.

  * For example, if `binary = "001"`, then all the **good** subsequences are `["0", "0", "1"]`, so the **unique** good subsequences are `"0"` and `"1"`. Note that subsequences `"00"`, `"01"`, and `"001"` are not good because they have leading zeros.

Return _the number of **unique good subsequences** of _`binary`. Since the
answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by
deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining
elements.



**Example 1:**

> Input: binary = "001"
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: The good subsequences of binary are ["0", "0", "1"].
> 
> The unique good subsequences are "0" and "1".

**Example 2:**

> Input: binary = "11"
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: The good subsequences of binary are ["1", "1", "11"].
> 
> The unique good subsequences are "1" and "11".

**Example 3:**

> Input: binary = "101"
> 
> Output: 5
> 
> Explanation: The good subsequences of binary are ["1", "0", "1", "10", "11", "101"]. 
> 
> The unique good subsequences are "0", "1", "10", "11", and "101".

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= binary.length <= 105`
  * `binary` consists of only `'0'`s and `'1'`s.
