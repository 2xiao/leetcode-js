# [3310. Remove Methods From Project](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-methods-from-project/)

## 题目

You are maintaining a project that has `n` methods numbered from `0` to `n -
1`.

You are given two integers `n` and `k`, and a 2D integer array `invocations`,
where `invocations[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that method `ai` invokes method
`bi`.

There is a known bug in method `k`. Method `k`, along with any method invoked
by it, either **directly** or **indirectly** , are considered **suspicious**
and we aim to remove them.

A group of methods can only be removed if no method **outside** the group
invokes any methods **within** it.

Return an array containing all the remaining methods after removing all the
**suspicious** methods. You may return the answer in _any order_. If it is not
possible to remove **all** the suspicious methods, **none** should be removed.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4, k = 1, invocations = [[1,2],[0,1],[3,2]]

**Output:** [0,1,2,3]

**Explanation:**

Method 2 and method 1 are suspicious, but they are directly invoked by methods
3 and 0, which are not suspicious. We return all elements without removing
anything.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 5, k = 0, invocations = [[1,2],[0,2],[0,1],[3,4]]

**Output:** [3,4]

**Explanation:**

Methods 0, 1, and 2 are suspicious and they are not directly invoked by any
other method. We can remove them.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 3, k = 2, invocations = [[1,2],[0,1],[2,0]]

**Output:** []

**Explanation:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/07/20/graph.png)

All methods are suspicious. We can remove them.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= k <= n - 1`
- `0 <= invocations.length <= 2 * 10^5`
- `invocations[i] == [ai, bi]`
- `0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1`
- `ai != bi`
- `invocations[i] != invocations[j]`
