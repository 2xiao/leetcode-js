# [2583. Kth Largest Sum in a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-sum-in-a-binary-tree/)

## 题目

You are given the `root` of a binary tree and a positive integer `k`.

The **level sum** in the tree is the sum of the values of the nodes that are
on the **same** level.

Return _the_`kth` _**largest** level sum in the tree (not necessarily
distinct)_. If there are fewer than `k` levels in the tree, return `-1`.

**Note** that two nodes are on the same level if they have the same distance
from the root.

**Example 1:**

> Input: root = [5,8,9,2,1,3,7,4,6], k = 2
>
> Output: 13
>
> Explanation: The level sums are the following:
>
> - Level 1: 5.
> - Level 2: 8 + 9 = 17.
> - Level 3: 2 + 1 + 3 + 7 = 13.
> - Level 4: 4 + 6 = 10.
>
> The 2nd largest level sum is 13.

**Example 2:**

> Input: root = [1,2,null,3], k = 1
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: The largest level sum is 3.

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^6`
- `1 <= k <= n`
