# [2260. Minimum Consecutive Cards to Pick Up](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-consecutive-cards-to-pick-up)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `cards` where `cards[i]` represents the
**value** of the `ith` card. A pair of cards are **matching** if the cards
have the **same** value.

Return _the **minimum** number of **consecutive** cards you have to pick up to
have a pair of **matching** cards among the picked cards._ If it is impossible
to have matching cards, return `-1`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: cards = [3,4,2,3,4,7]
> 
> Output: 4
> 
> Explanation: We can pick up the cards [3,4,2,3] which contain a matching pair of cards with value 3. Note that picking up the cards [4,2,3,4] is also optimal.

**Example 2:**

> Input: cards = [1,0,5,3]
> 
> Output: -1
> 
> Explanation: There is no way to pick up a set of consecutive cards that contain a pair of matching cards.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= cards.length <= 105`
  * `0 <= cards[i] <= 106`
