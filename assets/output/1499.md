# [1499. Max Value of Equation](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-value-of-equation)

## 题目

You are given an array `points` containing the coordinates of points on a 2D
plane, sorted by the x-values, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` such that `xi <
xj` for all `1 <= i < j <= points.length`. You are also given an integer `k`.

Return _the maximum value of the equation_`yi + yj + |xi - xj|` where `|xi -
xj| <= k` and `1 <= i < j <= points.length`.

It is guaranteed that there exists at least one pair of points that satisfy
the constraint `|xi - xj| <= k`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** points = [[1,3],[2,0],[5,10],[6,-10]], k = 1
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** The first two points satisfy the condition |xi - xj| <= 1 and if we calculate the equation we get 3 + 0 + |1 - 2| = 4. Third and fourth points also satisfy the condition and give a value of 10 + -10 + |5 - 6| = 1.
    No other pairs satisfy the condition, so we return the max of 4 and 1.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** points = [[0,0],[3,0],[9,2]], k = 3
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** Only the first two points have an absolute difference of 3 or less in the x-values, and give the value of 0 + 0 + |0 - 3| = 3.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= points.length <= 105`
  * `points[i].length == 2`
  * `-108 <= xi, yi <= 108`
  * `0 <= k <= 2 * 108`
  * `xi < xj` for all `1 <= i < j <= points.length`
  * `xi` form a strictly increasing sequence.
