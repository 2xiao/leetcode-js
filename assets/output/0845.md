# [845. Longest Mountain in Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-mountain-in-array/)

## 题目

You may recall that an array `arr` is a **mountain array** if and only if:

  * `arr.length >= 3`
  * There exists some index `i` ( **0-indexed** ) with `0 < i < arr.length - 1` such that: 
> 
> * `arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]`
> 
> * `arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`

Given an integer array `arr`, return _the length of the longest subarray,
which is a mountain_. Return `0` if there is no mountain subarray.



**Example 1:**

> Input: arr = [2,1,4,7,3,2,5]
> 
> Output: 5
> 
> Explanation: The largest mountain is [1,4,7,3,2] which has length 5.

**Example 2:**

> Input: arr = [2,2,2]
> 
> Output: 0
> 
> Explanation: There is no mountain.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= arr.length <= 104`
  * `0 <= arr[i] <= 104`



**Follow up:**

  * Can you solve it using only one pass?
  * Can you solve it in `O(1)` space?
