# [2344. Minimum Deletions to Make Array Divisible](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-array-divisible/)

## 题目

You are given two positive integer arrays `nums` and `numsDivide`. You can
delete any number of elements from `nums`.

Return _the **minimum** number of deletions such that the **smallest** element
in _`nums` _**divides** all the elements of _`numsDivide`. If this is not
possible, return `-1`.

Note that an integer `x` divides `y` if `y % x == 0`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [2,3,2,4,3], numsDivide = [9,6,9,3,15]
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation:
>
> The smallest element in [2,3,2,4,3] is 2, which does not divide all the elements of numsDivide.
>
> We use 2 deletions to delete the elements in nums that are equal to 2 which makes nums = [3,4,3].
>
> The smallest element in [3,4,3] is 3, which divides all the elements of numsDivide.
>
> It can be shown that 2 is the minimum number of deletions needed.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [4,3,6], numsDivide = [8,2,6,10]
>
> Output: -1
>
> Explanation:
>
> We want the smallest element in nums to divide all the elements of numsDivide.
>
> There is no way to delete elements from nums to allow this.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length, numsDivide.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i], numsDivide[i] <= 10^9`
