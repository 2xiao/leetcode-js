# [572. Subtree of Another Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/subtree-of-another-tree)

## 题目

Given the roots of two binary trees `root` and `subRoot`, return `true` if
there is a subtree of `root` with the same structure and node values of`
subRoot` and `false` otherwise.

A subtree of a binary tree `tree` is a tree that consists of a node in `tree`
and all of this node's descendants. The tree `tree` could also be considered
as a subtree of itself.



**Example 1:**

> Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]
> 
> Output: true

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/28/subtree2-tree.jpg)

> Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2,null,null,null,null,0], subRoot = [4,1,2]
> 
> Output: false

**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in the `root` tree is in the range `[1, 2000]`.
  * The number of nodes in the `subRoot` tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
  * `-104 <= root.val <= 104`
  * `-104 <= subRoot.val <= 104`
