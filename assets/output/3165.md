# [3165. Maximum Sum of Subsequence With Non-adjacent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-of-subsequence-with-non-adjacent-elements/)

## 题目

You are given an array `nums` consisting of integers. You are also given a 2D
array `queries`, where `queries[i] = [posi, xi]`.

For query `i`, we first set `nums[posi]` equal to `xi`, then we calculate the
answer to query `i` which is the **maximum** sum of a subsequence of `nums`
where **no two adjacent elements are selected**.

Return the _sum_ of the answers to all queries.

Since the final answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by
deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining
elements.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [3,5,9], queries = [[1,-2],[0,-3]]

**Output:** 21

**Explanation:**  
After the 1st query, `nums = [3,-2,9]` and the maximum sum of a subsequence
with non-adjacent elements is `3 + 9 = 12`.  
After the 2nd query, `nums = [-3,-2,9]` and the maximum sum of a subsequence
with non-adjacent elements is 9.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [0,-1], queries = [[0,-5]]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**  
After the 1st query, `nums = [-5,-1]` and the maximum sum of a subsequence
with non-adjacent elements is 0 (choosing an empty subsequence).

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `queries[i] == [posi, xi]`
- `0 <= posi <= nums.length - 1`
- `-10^5 <= xi <= 10^5`
