# [2918. Minimum Equal Sum of Two Arrays After Replacing Zeros](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-equal-sum-of-two-arrays-after-replacing-zeros)

## 题目

You are given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2` consisting of positive integers.

You have to replace **all** the `0`'s in both arrays with **strictly**
positive integers such that the sum of elements of both arrays becomes
**equal**.

Return _the **minimum** equal sum you can obtain, or _`-1` _if it is
impossible_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums1 = [3,2,0,1,0], nums2 = [6,5,0]
    **Output:** 12
    **Explanation:** We can replace 0's in the following way:
    - Replace the two 0's in nums1 with the values 2 and 4. The resulting array is nums1 = [3,2,2,1,4].
    - Replace the 0 in nums2 with the value 1. The resulting array is nums2 = [6,5,1].
    Both arrays have an equal sum of 12. It can be shown that it is the minimum sum we can obtain.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums1 = [2,0,2,0], nums2 = [1,4]
    **Output:** -1
    **Explanation:** It is impossible to make the sum of both arrays equal.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 105`
  * `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 106`
