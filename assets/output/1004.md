# [1004. Max Consecutive Ones III](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii)

## 题目

Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the maximum number of
consecutive_`1` _' s in the array if you can flip at most_ `k` `0`'s.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
    **Output:** 6
    **Explanation:** [1,1,1,0,0, _ **1** ,1,1,1,1, **1**_ ]
    Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
    **Output:** 10
    **Explanation:** [0,0, _1,1, **1** , **1** ,1,1,1, **1** ,1,1_,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
    Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.
  * `0 <= k <= nums.length`
