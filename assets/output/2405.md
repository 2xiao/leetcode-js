# [2405. Optimal Partition of String](https://leetcode.com/problems/optimal-partition-of-string)

## 题目

Given a string `s`, partition the string into one or more **substrings** such
that the characters in each substring are **unique**. That is, no letter
appears in a single substring more than **once**.

Return _the **minimum** number of substrings in such a partition._

Note that each character should belong to exactly one substring in a
partition.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "abacaba"
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:**
    Two possible partitions are ("a","ba","cab","a") and ("ab","a","ca","ba").
    It can be shown that 4 is the minimum number of substrings needed.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "ssssss"
    **Output:** 6
    **Explanation:** The only valid partition is ("s","s","s","s","s","s").
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `s` consists of only English lowercase letters.
