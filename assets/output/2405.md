# [2405. Optimal Partition of String](https://leetcode.com/problems/optimal-partition-of-string)

## 题目

Given a string `s`, partition the string into one or more **substrings** such
that the characters in each substring are **unique**. That is, no letter
appears in a single substring more than **once**.

Return _the **minimum** number of substrings in such a partition._

Note that each character should belong to exactly one substring in a
partition.



**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "abacaba"
> 
> Output: 4
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> Two possible partitions are ("a","ba","cab","a") and ("ab","a","ca","ba").
> 
> It can be shown that 4 is the minimum number of substrings needed.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "ssssss"
> 
> Output: 6
> 
> Explanation: The only valid partition is ("s","s","s","s","s","s").

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `s` consists of only English lowercase letters.
