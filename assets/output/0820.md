# [820. Short Encoding of Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/short-encoding-of-words)

## 题目

A **valid encoding** of an array of `words` is any reference string `s` and
array of indices `indices` such that:

  * `words.length == indices.length`
  * The reference string `s` ends with the `'#'` character.
  * For each index `indices[i]`, the **substring** of `s` starting from `indices[i]` and up to (but not including) the next `'#'` character is equal to `words[i]`.

Given an array of `words`, return _the **length of the shortest reference
string** _`s` _possible of any **valid encoding** of _`words` _._



**Example 1:**

> Input: words = ["time", "me", "bell"]
> 
> Output: 10
> 
> Explanation: A valid encoding would be s = "time#bell#" and indices = [0, 2, 5].
> 
> words[0] = "time", the substring of s starting from indices[0] = 0 to the next '#' is underlined in " _time_ #bell#"
> 
> words[1] = "me", the substring of s starting from indices[1] = 2 to the next '#' is underlined in "ti _me_ #bell#"
> 
> words[2] = "bell", the substring of s starting from indices[2] = 5 to the next '#' is underlined in "time# _bell_ #"

**Example 2:**

> Input: words = ["t"]
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: A valid encoding would be s = "t#" and indices = [0].

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= words.length <= 2000`
  * `1 <= words[i].length <= 7`
  * `words[i]` consists of only lowercase letters.
