# [834. Sum of Distances in Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-distances-in-tree)

## 题目

There is an undirected connected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n -
1` and `n - 1` edges.

You are given the integer `n` and the array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai,
bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree.

Return an array `answer` of length `n` where `answer[i]` is the sum of the
distances between the `ith` node in the tree and all other nodes.



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]
    **Output:** [8,12,6,10,10,10]
    **Explanation:** The tree is shown above.
    We can see that dist(0,1) + dist(0,2) + dist(0,3) + dist(0,4) + dist(0,5)
    equals 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8.
    Hence, answer[0] = 8, and so on.
    

**Example 2:**

    **Input:** n = 1, edges = []
    **Output:** [0]
    

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-sumdist3.jpg)

    
    
    **Input:** n = 2, edges = [[1,0]]
    **Output:** [1,1]
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 3 * 104`
  * `edges.length == n - 1`
  * `edges[i].length == 2`
  * `0 <= ai, bi < n`
  * `ai != bi`
  * The given input represents a valid tree.
