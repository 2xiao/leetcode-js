## 题目

You are given an integer array `score` of size `n`, where `score[i]` is the
score of the `ith` athlete in a competition. All the scores are guaranteed to
be **unique**.

The athletes are **placed** based on their scores, where the `1st` place
athlete has the highest score, the `2nd` place athlete has the `2nd` highest
score, and so on. The placement of each athlete determines their rank:

  * The `1st` place athlete's rank is `"Gold Medal"`.
  * The `2nd` place athlete's rank is `"Silver Medal"`.
  * The `3rd` place athlete's rank is `"Bronze Medal"`.
  * For the `4th` place to the `nth` place athlete, their rank is their placement number (i.e., the `xth` place athlete's rank is `"x"`).

Return an array `answer` of size `n` where `answer[i]` is the **rank** of the
`ith` athlete.



**Example 1:**

> Input: score = [5,4,3,2,1]
> 
> Output: ["Gold Medal","Silver Medal","Bronze Medal","4","5"]
> 
> Explanation: The placements are [1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th].

**Example 2:**

> Input: score = [10,3,8,9,4]
> 
> Output: ["Gold Medal","5","Bronze Medal","Silver Medal","4"]
> 
> Explanation: The placements are [1st, 5th, 3rd, 2nd, 4th].
> 
> 

**Constraints:**

  * `n == score.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 10^4`
  * `0 <= score[i] <= 10^6`
  * All the values in `score` are **unique**.


## 题目大意

给你一个长度为 `n` 的整数数组 `score` ，其中 `score[i]` 是第 `i` 位运动员在比赛中的得分。所有得分都 **互不相同** 。

运动员将根据得分 **决定名次** ，其中名次第 `1` 的运动员得分最高，名次第 `2` 的运动员得分第 `2`
高，依此类推。运动员的名次决定了他们的获奖情况：

  * 名次第 `1` 的运动员获金牌 `"Gold Medal"` 。
  * 名次第 `2` 的运动员获银牌 `"Silver Medal"` 。
  * 名次第 `3` 的运动员获铜牌 `"Bronze Medal"` 。
  * 从名次第 `4` 到第 `n` 的运动员，只能获得他们的名次编号（即，名次第 `x` 的运动员获得编号 `"x"`）。

使用长度为 `n` 的数组 `answer` 返回获奖，其中 `answer[i]` 是第 `i` 位运动员的获奖情况。



**示例 1：**

> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> **输入：** score = [5,4,3,2,1]
> 
> **输出：**["Gold Medal","Silver Medal","Bronze Medal","4","5"]
> 
> **解释：** 名次为 [1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th] 。

**示例 2：**

> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> **输入：** score = [10,3,8,9,4]
> 
> **输出：**["Gold Medal","5","Bronze Medal","Silver Medal","4"]
> 
> **解释：** 名次为 [1st, 5th, 3rd, 2nd, 4th] 。
> 
> 



**提示：**

  * `n == score.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 10^4`
  * `0 <= score[i] <= 10^6`
  * `score` 中的所有值 **互不相同**
