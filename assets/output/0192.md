# [192. Word Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-frequency)

## 题目

Write a bash script to calculate the frequency of each word in a text file
`words.txt`.

For simplicity sake, you may assume:

  * `words.txt` contains only lowercase characters and space `' '` characters.
  * Each word must consist of lowercase characters only.
  * Words are separated by one or more whitespace characters.

**Example:**

Assume that `words.txt` has the following content:

> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> the day is sunny the the
> 
> the sunny is is
> 
> 

Your script should output the following, sorted by descending frequency:

> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> the 4
> 
> is 3
> 
> sunny 2
> 
> day 1
> 
> 

**Note:**

  * Don't worry about handling ties, it is guaranteed that each word's frequency count is unique.
  * Could you write it in one-line using [Unix pipes](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO-4.html)?
