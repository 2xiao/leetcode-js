# [2958. Length of Longest Subarray With at Most K Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-longest-subarray-with-at-most-k-frequency/)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

The **frequency** of an element `x` is the number of times it occurs in an
array.

An array is called **good** if the frequency of each element in this array is
**less than or equal** to `k`.

Return _the length of the**longest** **good** subarray of_ `nums` _._

A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2], k = 2
>
> Output: 6
>
> Explanation: The longest possible good subarray is [1,2,3,1,2,3] since the values 1, 2, and 3 occur at most twice in this subarray. Note that the subarrays [2,3,1,2,3,1] and [3,1,2,3,1,2] are also good.
>
> It can be shown that there are no good subarrays with length more than 6.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2], k = 1
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: The longest possible good subarray is [1,2] since the values 1 and 2 occur at most once in this subarray. Note that the subarray [2,1] is also good.
>
> It can be shown that there are no good subarrays with length more than 2.

**Example 3:**

> Input: nums = [5,5,5,5,5,5,5], k = 4
>
> Output: 4
>
> Explanation: The longest possible good subarray is [5,5,5,5] since the value 5 occurs 4 times in this subarray.
>
> It can be shown that there are no good subarrays with length more than 4.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= k <= nums.length`
