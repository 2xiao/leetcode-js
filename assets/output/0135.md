# [135. Candy](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy)

## 题目

There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating
value given in the integer array `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following
requirements:

  * Each child must have at least one candy.
  * Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return _the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the
candies to the children_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
> 
> Output: 5
> 
> Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.

**Example 2:**

> Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
> 
> Output: 4
> 
> Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
> 
> The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

**Constraints:**

  * `n == ratings.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
  * `0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104`
