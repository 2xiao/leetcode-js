# [3111. Minimum Rectangles to Cover Points](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-rectangles-to-cover-points/)

## 题目

You are given a 2D integer array `points`, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`. You
are also given an integer `w`. Your task is to **cover** **all** the given
points with rectangles.

Each rectangle has its lower end at some point `(x1, 0)` and its upper end at
some point `(x2, y2)`, where `x1 <= x2`, `y2 >= 0`, and the condition `x2 - x1
<= w` **must** be satisfied for each rectangle.

A point is considered covered by a rectangle if it lies within or on the
boundary of the rectangle.

Return an integer denoting the **minimum** number of rectangles needed so that
each point is covered by **at least one** rectangle _._

**Note:** A point may be covered by more than one rectangle.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** points = [[2,1],[1,0],[1,4],[1,8],[3,5],[4,6]], w = 1

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The image above shows one possible placement of rectangles to cover the
points:

- A rectangle with a lower end at `(1, 0)` and its upper end at `(2, 8)`
- A rectangle with a lower end at `(3, 0)` and its upper end at `(4, 8)`

**Example 2:**

**Input:** points = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5],[6,6]], w = 2

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

The image above shows one possible placement of rectangles to cover the
points:

- A rectangle with a lower end at `(0, 0)` and its upper end at `(2, 2)`
- A rectangle with a lower end at `(3, 0)` and its upper end at `(5, 5)`
- A rectangle with a lower end at `(6, 0)` and its upper end at `(6, 6)`

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/03/04/screenshot-
from-2024-03-04-20-24-03.png)

**Input:** points = [[2,3],[1,2]], w = 0

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The image above shows one possible placement of rectangles to cover the
points:

- A rectangle with a lower end at `(1, 0)` and its upper end at `(1, 2)`
- A rectangle with a lower end at `(2, 0)` and its upper end at `(2, 3)`

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= points.length <= 10^5`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= xi == points[i][0] <= 10^9`
- `0 <= yi == points[i][1] <= 10^9`
- `0 <= w <= 10^9`
- All pairs `(xi, yi)` are distinct.
