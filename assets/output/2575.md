# [2575. Find the Divisibility Array of a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-divisibility-array-of-a-string/)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** string `word` of length `n` consisting of
digits, and a positive integer `m`.

The **divisibility array** `div` of `word` is an integer array of length `n`
such that:

- `div[i] = 1` if the **numeric value** of `word[0,...,i]` is divisible by `m`, or
- `div[i] = 0` otherwise.

Return _the divisibility array of_ \_\_`word`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: word = "998244353", m = 3
>
> Output: [1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0]
>
> Explanation: There are only 4 prefixes that are divisible by 3: "9", "99", "998244", and "9982443".

**Example 2:**

> Input: word = "1010", m = 10
>
> Output: [0,1,0,1]
>
> Explanation: There are only 2 prefixes that are divisible by 10: "10", and "1010".

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `word.length == n`
- `word` consists of digits from `0` to `9`
- `1 <= m <= 10^9`
