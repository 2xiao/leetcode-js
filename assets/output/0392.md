# [392. Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence)

## 题目

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` _if_`s` _is a **subsequence** of
_`t` _, or_`false` _otherwise_.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original
string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the
relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a
subsequence of `" _a_ b _c_ d _e_ "` while `"aec"` is not).



**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
> 
> Output: true

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
> 
> Output: false

**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= s.length <= 100`
  * `0 <= t.length <= 104`
  * `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.



**Follow up:** Suppose there are lots of incoming `s`, say `s1, s2, ..., sk`
where `k >= 109`, and you want to check one by one to see if `t` has its
subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?
