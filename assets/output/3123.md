# [3123. Find Edges in Shortest Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-edges-in-shortest-paths/)

## 题目

You are given an undirected weighted graph of `n` nodes numbered from 0 to `n

- 1`. The graph consists of `m`edges represented by a 2D array`edges`, where
`edges[i] = [ai, bi, wi]`indicates that there is an edge between nodes`ai`and`bi`with weight`wi`.

Consider all the shortest paths from node 0 to node `n - 1` in the graph. You
need to find a **boolean** array `answer` where `answer[i]` is `true` if the
edge `edges[i]` is part of **at least** one shortest path. Otherwise,
`answer[i]` is `false`.

Return the array `answer`.

**Note** that the graph may not be connected.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 6, edges =
[[0,1,4],[0,2,1],[1,3,2],[1,4,3],[1,5,1],[2,3,1],[3,5,3],[4,5,2]]

**Output:** [true,true,true,false,true,true,true,false]

**Explanation:**

The following are **all** the shortest paths between nodes 0 and 5:

- The path `0 -> 1 -> 5`: The sum of weights is `4 + 1 = 5`.
- The path `0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5`: The sum of weights is `1 + 1 + 3 = 5`.
- The path `0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 5`: The sum of weights is `1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5`.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/03/05/graphhhh.png)

**Input:** n = 4, edges = [[2,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,3,4],[3,2,2]]

**Output:** [true,false,false,true]

**Explanation:**

There is one shortest path between nodes 0 and 3, which is the path `0 -> 2 ->
3` with the sum of weights `1 + 2 = 3`.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
- `m == edges.length`
- `1 <= m <= min(5 * 104, n * (n - 1) / 2)`
- `0 <= ai, bi < n`
- `ai != bi`
- `1 <= wi <= 10^5`
- There are no repeated edges.
