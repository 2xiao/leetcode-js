# [768. Max Chunks To Make Sorted II](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-chunks-to-make-sorted-ii)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `arr`.

We split `arr` into some number of **chunks** (i.e., partitions), and
individually sort each chunk. After concatenating them, the result should
equal the sorted array.

Return _the largest number of chunks we can make to sort the array_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** arr = [5,4,3,2,1]
    **Output:** 1
    **Explanation:**
    Splitting into two or more chunks will not return the required result.
    For example, splitting into [5, 4], [3, 2, 1] will result in [4, 5, 1, 2, 3], which isn't sorted.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** arr = [2,1,3,4,4]
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:**
    We can split into two chunks, such as [2, 1], [3, 4, 4].
    However, splitting into [2, 1], [3], [4], [4] is the highest number of chunks possible.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= arr.length <= 2000`
  * `0 <= arr[i] <= 108`
