# [1954. Minimum Garden Perimeter to Collect Enough Apples](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-garden-perimeter-to-collect-enough-apples/)

## 题目

In a garden represented as an infinite 2D grid, there is an apple tree planted
at **every** integer coordinate. The apple tree planted at an integer
coordinate `(i, j)` has `|i| + |j|` apples growing on it.

You will buy an axis-aligned **square plot** of land that is centered at `(0,
0)`.

Given an integer `neededApples`, return _the **minimum perimeter** of a plot
such that **at least**_ ****`neededApples` _apples are **inside or on** the
perimeter of that plot_.

The value of `|x|` is defined as:

  * `x` if `x >= 0`
  * `-x` if `x < 0`



**Example 1:**

> Input: neededApples = 1
> 
> Output: 8
> 
> Explanation: A square plot of side length 1 does not contain any apples.
> 
> However, a square plot of side length 2 has 12 apples inside (as depicted in the image above).
> 
> The perimeter is 2 * 4 = 8.

**Example 2:**

> Input: neededApples = 13
> 
> Output: 16

**Example 3:**

> Input: neededApples = 1000000000
> 
> Output: 5040

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= neededApples <= 1015`
