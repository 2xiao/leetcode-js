# [1828. Queries on Number of Points Inside a Circle](https://leetcode.com/problems/queries-on-number-of-points-inside-a-circle/)

## 题目

You are given an array `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` is the
coordinates of the `ith` point on a 2D plane. Multiple points can have the
**same** coordinates.

You are also given an array `queries` where `queries[j] = [xj, yj, rj]`
describes a circle centered at `(xj, yj)` with a radius of `rj`.

For each query `queries[j]`, compute the number of points **inside** the `jth`
circle. Points **on the border** of the circle are considered **inside**.

Return _an array_`answer` _, where_`answer[j]` _is the answer to the_`jth`
_query_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: points = [[1,3],[3,3],[5,3],[2,2]], queries = [[2,3,1],[4,3,1],[1,1,2]]
> 
> Output: [3,2,2]
> 
> Explanation: The points and circles are shown above.
> 
> queries[0] is the green circle, queries[1] is the red circle, and queries[2] is the blue circle.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/25/chrome_2021-03-25_22-42-07.png)

> Input: points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5]], queries = [[1,2,2],[2,2,2],[4,3,2],[4,3,3]]
> 
> Output: [2,3,2,4]
> 
> Explanation: The points and circles are shown above.
> 
> queries[0] is green, queries[1] is red, queries[2] is blue, and queries[3] is purple.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= points.length <= 500`
  * `points[i].length == 2`
  * `0 <= x​​​​​​i, y​​​​​​i <= 500`
  * `1 <= queries.length <= 500`
  * `queries[j].length == 3`
  * `0 <= xj, yj <= 500`
  * `1 <= rj <= 500`
  * All coordinates are integers.

than `O(n)`?
