# [2315. Count Asterisks](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-asterisks)

## 题目

You are given a string `s`, where every **two** consecutive vertical bars
`'|'` are grouped into a **pair**. In other words, the 1st and 2nd `'|'` make
a pair, the 3rd and 4th `'|'` make a pair, and so forth.

Return _the number of_`'*'` _in_`s` _, **excluding** the _`'*'` _between each
pair of_`'|'`.

**Note** that each `'|'` will belong to **exactly** one pair.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "l|*e*et|c**o|*de|"
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** The considered characters are underlined: " _l_ |*e*et| _c**o_ |*de|".
    The characters between the first and second '|' are excluded from the answer.
    Also, the characters between the third and fourth '|' are excluded from the answer.
    There are 2 asterisks considered. Therefore, we return 2.

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "iamprogrammer"
    **Output:** 0
    **Explanation:** In this example, there are no asterisks in s. Therefore, we return 0.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "yo|uar|e**|b|e***au|tifu|l"
    **Output:** 5
    **Explanation:** The considered characters are underlined: " _yo_ |uar| _e**_ |b| _e***au_ |tifu| _l_ ". There are 5 asterisks considered. Therefore, we return 5.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
  * `s` consists of lowercase English letters, vertical bars `'|'`, and asterisks `'*'`.
  * `s` contains an **even** number of vertical bars `'|'`.
