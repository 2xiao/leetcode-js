# [1030. Matrix Cells in Distance Order](https://leetcode.com/problems/matrix-cells-in-distance-order/)

## 题目

You are given four integers `row`, `cols`, `rCenter`, and `cCenter`. There is
a `rows x cols` matrix and you are on the cell with the coordinates `(rCenter,
cCenter)`.

Return _the coordinates of all cells in the matrix, sorted by their
**distance** from _`(rCenter, cCenter)` _from the smallest distance to the
largest distance_. You may return the answer in **any order** that satisfies
this condition.

The **distance** between two cells `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` is `|r1 - r2| +
|c1 - c2|`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: rows = 1, cols = 2, rCenter = 0, cCenter = 0
> 
> Output: [[0,0],[0,1]]
> 
> Explanation: The distances from (0, 0) to other cells are: [0,1]

**Example 2:**

> Input: rows = 2, cols = 2, rCenter = 0, cCenter = 1
> 
> Output: [[0,1],[0,0],[1,1],[1,0]]
> 
> Explanation: The distances from (0, 1) to other cells are: [0,1,1,2]
> 
> The answer [[0,1],[1,1],[0,0],[1,0]] would also be accepted as correct.

**Example 3:**

> Input: rows = 2, cols = 3, rCenter = 1, cCenter = 2
> 
> Output: [[1,2],[0,2],[1,1],[0,1],[1,0],[0,0]]
> 
> Explanation: The distances from (1, 2) to other cells are: [0,1,1,2,2,3]
> 
> There are other answers that would also be accepted as correct, such as [[1,2],[1,1],[0,2],[1,0],[0,1],[0,0]].

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= rows, cols <= 100`
  * `0 <= rCenter < rows`
  * `0 <= cCenter < cols`
