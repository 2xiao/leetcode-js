# [2429. Minimize XOR](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-xor)

## 题目

Given two positive integers `num1` and `num2`, find the positive integer `x`
such that:

  * `x` has the same number of set bits as `num2`, and
  * The value `x XOR num1` is **minimal**.

Note that `XOR` is the bitwise XOR operation.

Return _the integer_`x`. The test cases are generated such that `x` is
**uniquely determined**.

The number of **set bits** of an integer is the number of `1`'s in its binary
representation.



**Example 1:**

> Input: num1 = 3, num2 = 5
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> The binary representations of num1 and num2 are 0011 and 0101, respectively.
> 
> The integer **3** has the same number of set bits as num2, and the value 3 XOR 3 = 0 is minimal.

**Example 2:**

> Input: num1 = 1, num2 = 12
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> The binary representations of num1 and num2 are 0001 and 1100, respectively.
> 
> The integer **3** has the same number of set bits as num2, and the value 3 XOR 1 = 2 is minimal.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= num1, num2 <= 109`
