# [1221. Split a String in Balanced Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-a-string-in-balanced-strings)

## 题目

**Balanced** strings are those that have an equal quantity of `'L'` and `'R'`
characters.

Given a **balanced** string `s`, split it into some number of substrings such
that:

  * Each substring is balanced.

Return _the **maximum** number of balanced strings you can obtain._



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "RLRRRLLRLL"
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** s can be split into "RL", "RRRLLRLL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
    Note that s cannot be split into "RL", "RR", "RL", "LR", "LL", because the 2nd and 5th substrings are not balanced.

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "LLLLRRRR"
    **Output:** 1
    **Explanation:** s can be split into "LLLLRRRR".
    



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= s.length <= 1000`
  * `s[i]` is either `'L'` or `'R'`.
  * `s` is a **balanced** string.
