# [2367. Number of Arithmetic Triplets](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-arithmetic-triplets/)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** , **strictly increasing** integer array `nums`
and a positive integer `diff`. A triplet `(i, j, k)` is an **arithmetic
triplet** if the following conditions are met:

- `i < j < k`,
- `nums[j] - nums[i] == diff`, and
- `nums[k] - nums[j] == diff`.

Return _the number of unique **arithmetic triplets**._

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [0,1,4,6,7,10], diff = 3
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation:
>
> (1, 2, 4) is an arithmetic triplet because both 7 - 4 == 3 and 4 - 1 == 3.
>
> (2, 4, 5) is an arithmetic triplet because both 10 - 7 == 3 and 7 - 4 == 3.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,8,9], diff = 2
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation:
>
> (0, 2, 4) is an arithmetic triplet because both 8 - 6 == 2 and 6 - 4 == 2.
>
> (1, 3, 5) is an arithmetic triplet because both 9 - 7 == 2 and 7 - 5 == 2.

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= nums.length <= 200`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 200`
- `1 <= diff <= 50`
- `nums` is **strictly** increasing.
