# [332. Reconstruct Itinerary](https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary)

## 题目

You are given a list of airline `tickets` where `tickets[i] = [fromi, toi]`
represent the departure and the arrival airports of one flight. Reconstruct
the itinerary in order and return it.

All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from `"JFK"`, thus, the
itinerary must begin with `"JFK"`. If there are multiple valid itineraries,
you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read
as a single string.

  * For example, the itinerary `["JFK", "LGA"]` has a smaller lexical order than `["JFK", "LGB"]`.

You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary. You must use all
the tickets once and only once.



**Example 1:**

> Input: tickets = [["MUC","LHR"],["JFK","MUC"],["SFO","SJC"],["LHR","SFO"]]
> 
> Output: ["JFK","MUC","LHR","SFO","SJC"]

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/itinerary2-graph.jpg)

> Input: tickets = [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
> 
> Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
> 
> Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"] but it is larger in lexical order.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= tickets.length <= 300`
  * `tickets[i].length == 2`
  * `fromi.length == 3`
  * `toi.length == 3`
  * `fromi` and `toi` consist of uppercase English letters.
  * `fromi != toi`
