# [2699. Modify Graph Edge Weights](https://leetcode.com/problems/modify-graph-edge-weights)

## 题目

You are given an **undirected weighted** **connected** graph containing `n`
nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an integer array `edges` where
`edges[i] = [ai, bi, wi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai`
and `bi` with weight `wi`.

Some edges have a weight of `-1` (`wi = -1`), while others have a **positive**
weight (`wi > 0`).

Your task is to modify **all edges** with a weight of `-1` by assigning them
**positive integer values** in the range `[1, 2 * 109]` so that the **shortest
distance** between the nodes `source` and `destination` becomes equal to an
integer `target`. If there are **multiple** **modifications** that make the
shortest distance between `source` and `destination` equal to `target`, any of
them will be considered correct.

Return _an array containing all edges (even unmodified ones) in any order if
it is possible to make the shortest distance from_`source` _to_`destination`
_equal to_`target` _, or an **empty array** if it's impossible._

**Note:** You are not allowed to modify the weights of edges with initial
positive weights.



**Example 1:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/04/18/graph.png)**

> Input: n = 5, edges = [[4,1,-1],[2,0,-1],[0,3,-1],[4,3,-1]], source = 0, destination = 1, target = 5
> 
> Output: [[4,1,1],[2,0,1],[0,3,3],[4,3,1]]
> 
> Explanation: The graph above shows a possible modification to the edges, making the distance from 0 to 1 equal to 5.

**Example 2:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/04/18/graph-2.png)**

> Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,-1],[0,2,5]], source = 0, destination = 2, target = 6
> 
> Output: []
> 
> Explanation: The graph above contains the initial edges. It is not possible to make the distance from 0 to 2 equal to 6 by modifying the edge with weight -1. So, an empty array is returned.

**Example 3:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/04/19/graph-3.png)**

> Input: n = 4, edges = [[1,0,4],[1,2,3],[2,3,5],[0,3,-1]], source = 0, destination = 2, target = 6
> 
> Output: [[1,0,4],[1,2,3],[2,3,5],[0,3,1]]
> 
> Explanation: The graph above shows a modified graph having the shortest distance from 0 to 2 as 6.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 100`
  * `1 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
  * `edges[i].length == 3`
  * `0 <= ai, bi < n`
  * `wi = -1 `or `1 <= wi <= 107`
  * `ai != bi`
  * `0 <= source, destination < n`
  * `source != destination`
  * `1 <= target <= 109`
  * The graph is connected, and there are no self-loops or repeated edges
