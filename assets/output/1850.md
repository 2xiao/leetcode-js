# [1850. Minimum Adjacent Swaps to Reach the Kth Smallest Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-adjacent-swaps-to-reach-the-kth-smallest-number)

## 题目

You are given a string `num`, representing a large integer, and an integer
`k`.

We call some integer **wonderful** if it is a **permutation** of the digits in
`num` and is **greater in value** than `num`. There can be many wonderful
integers. However, we only care about the **smallest-valued** ones.

  * For example, when `num = "5489355142"`: 
    * The 1st smallest wonderful integer is `"5489355214"`.
    * The 2nd smallest wonderful integer is `"5489355241"`.
    * The 3rd smallest wonderful integer is `"5489355412"`.
    * The 4th smallest wonderful integer is `"5489355421"`.

Return _the **minimum number of adjacent digit swaps** that needs to be
applied to _`num` _to reach the_`kth` _ **smallest wonderful** integer_.

The tests are generated in such a way that `kth` smallest wonderful integer
exists.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** num = "5489355142", k = 4
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** The 4th smallest wonderful number is "5489355421". To get this number:
    - Swap index 7 with index 8: "5489355 _14_ 2" -> "5489355 _41_ 2"
    - Swap index 8 with index 9: "54893554 _12_ " -> "54893554 _21_ "
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** num = "11112", k = 4
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** The 4th smallest wonderful number is "21111". To get this number:
    - Swap index 3 with index 4: "111 _12_ " -> "111 _21_ "
    - Swap index 2 with index 3: "11 _12_ 1" -> "11 _21_ 1"
    - Swap index 1 with index 2: "1 _12_ 11" -> "1 _21_ 11"
    - Swap index 0 with index 1: " _12_ 111" -> " _21_ 111"
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** num = "00123", k = 1
    **Output:** 1
    **Explanation:** The 1st smallest wonderful number is "00132". To get this number:
    - Swap index 3 with index 4: "001 _23_ " -> "001 _32_ "
    



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= num.length <= 1000`
  * `1 <= k <= 1000`
  * `num` only consists of digits.
