# [566. Reshape the Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/reshape-the-matrix)

## 题目

In MATLAB, there is a handy function called `reshape` which can reshape an `m
x n` matrix into a new one with a different size `r x c` keeping its original
data.

You are given an `m x n` matrix `mat` and two integers `r` and `c`
representing the number of rows and the number of columns of the wanted
reshaped matrix.

The reshaped matrix should be filled with all the elements of the original
matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.

If the `reshape` operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output
the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** mat = [[1,2],[3,4]], r = 1, c = 4
    **Output:** [[1,2,3,4]]
    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/24/reshape2-grid.jpg)

    
    
    **Input:** mat = [[1,2],[3,4]], r = 2, c = 4
    **Output:** [[1,2],[3,4]]
    



**Constraints:**

  * `m == mat.length`
  * `n == mat[i].length`
  * `1 <= m, n <= 100`
  * `-1000 <= mat[i][j] <= 1000`
  * `1 <= r, c <= 300`
