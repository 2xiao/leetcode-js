# [438. Find All Anagrams in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string)

## 题目

Given two strings `s` and `p`, return _an array of all the start indices
of_`p` _' s anagrams in _`s`. You may return the answer in **any order**.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a
different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly
once.



**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
> 
> Output: [0,6]
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
> 
> The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
> 
> Output: [0,1,2]
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
> 
> The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
> 
> The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 104`
  * `s` and `p` consist of lowercase English letters.
