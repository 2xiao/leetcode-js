# [2561. Rearranging Fruits](https://leetcode.com/problems/rearranging-fruits/)

## 题目

You have two fruit baskets containing `n` fruits each. You are given two
**0-indexed** integer arrays `basket1` and `basket2` representing the cost of
fruit in each basket. You want to make both baskets **equal**. To do so, you
can use the following operation as many times as you want:

- Chose two indices `i` and `j`, and swap the `ith `fruit of `basket1` with the `jth` fruit of `basket2`.
- The cost of the swap is `min(basket1[i],basket2[j])`.

Two baskets are considered equal if sorting them according to the fruit cost
makes them exactly the same baskets.

Return _the minimum cost to make both the baskets equal or_`-1` _if
impossible._

**Example 1:**

> Input: basket1 = [4,2,2,2], basket2 = [1,4,1,2]
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation: Swap index 1 of basket1 with index 0 of basket2, which has cost 1. Now basket1 = [4,1,2,2] and basket2 = [2,4,1,2]. Rearranging both the arrays makes them equal.

**Example 2:**

> Input: basket1 = [2,3,4,1], basket2 = [3,2,5,1]
>
> Output: -1
>
> Explanation: It can be shown that it is impossible to make both the baskets equal.

**Constraints:**

- `basket1.length == basket2.length`
- `1 <= basket1.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= basket1[i],basket2[i] <= 10^9`
