# [3259. Maximum Energy Boost From Two Drinks](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-energy-boost-from-two-drinks/)

## 题目

You are given two integer arrays `energyDrinkA` and `energyDrinkB` of the same
length `n` by a futuristic sports scientist. These arrays represent the energy
boosts per hour provided by two different energy drinks, A and B,
respectively.

You want to _maximize_ your total energy boost by drinking one energy drink
_per hour_. However, if you want to switch from consuming one energy drink to
the other, you need to wait for _one hour_ to cleanse your system (meaning you
won't get any energy boost in that hour).

Return the **maximum** total energy boost you can gain in the next `n` hours.

**Note** that you can start consuming _either_ of the two energy drinks.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** energyDrinkA = [1,3,1], energyDrinkB = [3,1,1]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:**

To gain an energy boost of 5, drink only the energy drink A (or only B).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** energyDrinkA = [4,1,1], energyDrinkB = [1,1,3]

**Output:** 7

**Explanation:**

To gain an energy boost of 7:

- Drink the energy drink A for the first hour.
- Switch to the energy drink B and we lose the energy boost of the second hour.
- Gain the energy boost of the drink B in the third hour.

**Constraints:**

- `n == energyDrinkA.length == energyDrinkB.length`
- `3 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= energyDrinkA[i], energyDrinkB[i] <= 10^5`
