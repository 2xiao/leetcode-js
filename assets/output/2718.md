# [2718. Sum of Matrix After Queries](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-matrix-after-queries)

## 题目

You are given an integer `n` and a **0-indexed**   **2D array** `queries`
where `queries[i] = [typei, indexi, vali]`.

Initially, there is a **0-indexed** `n x n` matrix filled with `0`'s. For each
query, you must apply one of the following changes:

  * if `typei == 0`, set the values in the row with `indexi` to `vali`, overwriting any previous values.
  * if `typei == 1`, set the values in the column with `indexi` to `vali`, overwriting any previous values.

Return _the sum of integers in the matrix after all queries are applied_.



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** n = 3, queries = [[0,0,1],[1,2,2],[0,2,3],[1,0,4]]
    **Output:** 23
    **Explanation:** The image above describes the matrix after each query. The sum of the matrix after all queries are applied is 23. 
    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/05/11/exm2.png)

    
    
    **Input:** n = 3, queries = [[0,0,4],[0,1,2],[1,0,1],[0,2,3],[1,2,1]]
    **Output:** 17
    **Explanation:** The image above describes the matrix after each query. The sum of the matrix after all queries are applied is 17.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 104`
  * `1 <= queries.length <= 5 * 104`
  * `queries[i].length == 3`
  * `0 <= typei <= 1`
  * `0 <= indexi < n`
  * `0 <= vali <= 105`
