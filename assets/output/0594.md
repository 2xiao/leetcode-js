# [594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-harmonious-subsequence)

## 题目

We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its
maximum value and its minimum value is **exactly** `1`.

Given an integer array `nums`, return _the length of its longest harmonious
subsequence among all its possible subsequences_.

A **subsequence** of array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by
deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining
elements.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
    **Output:** 5
    **Explanation:** The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4]
    **Output:** 2
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [1,1,1,1]
    **Output:** 0
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104`
  * `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
