# [2816. Double a Number Represented as a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/double-a-number-represented-as-a-linked-list)

## 题目

You are given the `head` of a **non-empty** linked list representing a non-
negative integer without leading zeroes.

Return _the_`head` _of the linked list after **doubling** it_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: head = [1,8,9]
> 
> Output: [3,7,8]
> 
> Explanation: The figure above corresponds to the given linked list which represents the number 189. Hence, the returned linked list represents the number 189 * 2 = 378.

**Example 2:**

> Input: head = [9,9,9]
> 
> Output: [1,9,9,8]
> 
> Explanation: The figure above corresponds to the given linked list which represents the number 999. Hence, the returned linked list reprersents the number 999 * 2 = 1998. 

**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 104]`
  * `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
  * The input is generated such that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros, except the number `0` itself.
