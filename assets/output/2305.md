# [2305. Fair Distribution of Cookies](https://leetcode.com/problems/fair-distribution-of-cookies)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `cookies`, where `cookies[i]` denotes the
number of cookies in the `ith` bag. You are also given an integer `k` that
denotes the number of children to distribute **all** the bags of cookies to.
All the cookies in the same bag must go to the same child and cannot be split
up.

The **unfairness** of a distribution is defined as the **maximum** **total**
cookies obtained by a single child in the distribution.

Return _the **minimum** unfairness of all distributions_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: cookies = [8,15,10,20,8], k = 2
> 
> Output: 31
> 
> Explanation: One optimal distribution is [8,15,8] and [10,20]
> - The 1st child receives [8,15,8] which has a total of 8 + 15 + 8 = 31 cookies.
> - The 2nd child receives [10,20] which has a total of 10 + 20 = 30 cookies.
> 
> The unfairness of the distribution is max(31,30) = 31.
> 
> It can be shown that there is no distribution with an unfairness less than 31.

**Example 2:**

> Input: cookies = [6,1,3,2,2,4,1,2], k = 3
> 
> Output: 7
> 
> Explanation: One optimal distribution is [6,1], [3,2,2], and [4,1,2]
> - The 1st child receives [6,1] which has a total of 6 + 1 = 7 cookies.
> - The 2nd child receives [3,2,2] which has a total of 3 + 2 + 2 = 7 cookies.
> - The 3rd child receives [4,1,2] which has a total of 4 + 1 + 2 = 7 cookies.
> 
> The unfairness of the distribution is max(7,7,7) = 7.
> 
> It can be shown that there is no distribution with an unfairness less than 7.

**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= cookies.length <= 8`
  * `1 <= cookies[i] <= 105`
  * `2 <= k <= cookies.length`
