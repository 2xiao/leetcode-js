# [1129. Shortest Path with Alternating Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-with-alternating-colors/)

## 题目

You are given an integer `n`, the number of nodes in a directed graph where
the nodes are labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. Each edge is red or blue in this
graph, and there could be self-edges and parallel edges.

You are given two arrays `redEdges` and `blueEdges` where:

  * `redEdges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is a directed red edge from node `ai` to node `bi` in the graph, and
  * `blueEdges[j] = [uj, vj]` indicates that there is a directed blue edge from node `uj` to node `vj` in the graph.

Return an array `answer` of length `n`, where each `answer[x]` is the length
of the shortest path from node `0` to node `x` such that the edge colors
alternate along the path, or `-1` if such a path does not exist.



**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 3, redEdges = [[0,1],[1,2]], blueEdges = []
> 
> Output: [0,1,-1]

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 3, redEdges = [[0,1]], blueEdges = [[2,1]]
> 
> Output: [0,1,-1]

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 100`
  * `0 <= redEdges.length, blueEdges.length <= 400`
  * `redEdges[i].length == blueEdges[j].length == 2`
  * `0 <= ai, bi, uj, vj < n`
