# [2611. Mice and Cheese](https://leetcode.com/problems/mice-and-cheese/)

## 题目

There are two mice and `n` different types of cheese, each type of cheese
should be eaten by exactly one mouse.

A point of the cheese with index `i` ( **0-indexed** ) is:

  * `reward1[i]` if the first mouse eats it.
  * `reward2[i]` if the second mouse eats it.

You are given a positive integer array `reward1`, a positive integer array
`reward2`, and a non-negative integer `k`.

Return _**the maximum** points the mice can achieve if the first mouse eats
exactly _`k` _types of cheese._



**Example 1:**

> Input: reward1 = [1,1,3,4], reward2 = [4,4,1,1], k = 2
> 
> Output: 15
> 
> Explanation: In this example, the first mouse eats the 2nd (0-indexed) and the 3rd types of cheese, and the second mouse eats the 0th and the 1st types of cheese.
> 
> The total points are 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 15.
> 
> It can be proven that 15 is the maximum total points that the mice can achieve.

**Example 2:**

> Input: reward1 = [1,1], reward2 = [1,1], k = 2
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: In this example, the first mouse eats the 0th (0-indexed) and 1st types of cheese, and the second mouse does not eat any cheese.
> 
> The total points are 1 + 1 = 2.
> 
> It can be proven that 2 is the maximum total points that the mice can achieve.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n == reward1.length == reward2.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= reward1[i], reward2[i] <= 1000`
  * `0 <= k <= n`
