# [2595. Number of Even and Odd Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-even-and-odd-bits/)

## 题目

You are given a **positive** integer `n`.

Let `even` denote the number of even indices in the binary representation of
`n` ( **0-indexed** ) with value `1`.

Let `odd` denote the number of odd indices in the binary representation of `n`
( **0-indexed** ) with value `1`.

Return _an integer array_`answer` _where_`answer = [even, odd]`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 17
>
> Output: [2,0]
>
> Explanation: The binary representation of 17 is 10001.
>
> It contains 1 on the 0th and 4th indices.
>
> There are 2 even and 0 odd indices.

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 2
>
> Output: [0,1]
>
> Explanation: The binary representation of 2 is 10.
>
> It contains 1 on the 1st index.
>
> There are 0 even and 1 odd indices.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 1000`
