# [1806. Minimum Number of Operations to Reinitialize a Permutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-reinitialize-a-permutation/)

## 题目

You are given an **even** integer `n`​​​​​​. You initially have a permutation
`perm` of size `n`​​ where `perm[i] == i`​ **(0-indexed)** ​​​​.

In one operation, you will create a new array `arr`, and for each `i`:

- If `i % 2 == 0`, then `arr[i] = perm[i / 2]`.
- If `i % 2 == 1`, then `arr[i] = perm[n / 2 + (i - 1) / 2]`.

You will then assign `arr`​​​​ to `perm`.

Return _the minimum **non-zero** number of operations you need to perform on
_`perm` _to return the permutation to its initial value._

**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 2
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation: perm = [0,1] initially.
>
> After the 1st operation, perm = [0,1]
>
> So it takes only 1 operation.

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 4
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: perm = [0,1,2,3] initially.
>
> After the 1st operation, perm = [0,2,1,3]
>
> After the 2nd operation, perm = [0,1,2,3]
>
> So it takes only 2 operations.

**Example 3:**

> Input: n = 6
>
> Output: 4

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 1000`
- `n`​​​​​​ is even.
