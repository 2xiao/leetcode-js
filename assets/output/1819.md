# [1819. Number of Different Subsequences GCDs](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-different-subsequences-gcds/)

## 题目

You are given an array `nums` that consists of positive integers.

The **GCD** of a sequence of numbers is defined as the greatest integer that
divides **all** the numbers in the sequence evenly.

- For example, the GCD of the sequence `[4,6,16]` is `2`.

A **subsequence** of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing
some elements (possibly none) of the array.

- For example, `[2,5,10]` is a subsequence of `[1,2,1, ** _2_** ,4,1, _ **5**_ , _ **10**_ ]`.

Return _the **number** of **different** GCDs among all **non-empty**
subsequences of_ `nums`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [6,10,3]
>
> Output: 5
>
> Explanation: The figure shows all the non-empty subsequences and their GCDs.
>
> The different GCDs are 6, 10, 3, 2, and 1.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [5,15,40,5,6]
>
> Output: 7

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 2 * 10^5`
