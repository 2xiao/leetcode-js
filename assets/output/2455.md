# [2455. Average Value of Even Numbers That Are Divisible by Three](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-value-of-even-numbers-that-are-divisible-by-three/)

## 题目

Given an integer array `nums` of **positive** integers, return _the average
value of all even integers that are divisible by_ `3` _._

Note that the **average** of `n` elements is the **sum** of the `n` elements
divided by `n` and **rounded down** to the nearest integer.

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [1,3,6,10,12,15]
>
> Output: 9
>
> Explanation: 6 and 12 are even numbers that are divisible by 3. (6 + 12) / 2 = 9.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [1,2,4,7,10]
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation: There is no single number that satisfies the requirement, so return 0.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
