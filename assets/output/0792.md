# [792. Number of Matching Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-matching-subsequences)

## 题目

Given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`, return _the number of_
`words[i]` _that is a subsequence of_ `s`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original
string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the
relative order of the remaining characters.

  * For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "abcde", words = ["a","bb","acd","ace"]
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** There are three strings in words that are a subsequence of s: "a", "acd", "ace".
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "dsahjpjauf", words = ["ahjpjau","ja","ahbwzgqnuk","tnmlanowax"]
    **Output:** 2
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
  * `1 <= words.length <= 5000`
  * `1 <= words[i].length <= 50`
  * `s` and `words[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters.
