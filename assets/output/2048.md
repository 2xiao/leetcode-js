# [2048. Next Greater Numerically Balanced Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-numerically-balanced-number/)

## 题目

An integer `x` is **numerically balanced** if for every digit `d` in the
number `x`, there are **exactly** `d` occurrences of that digit in `x`.

Given an integer `n`, return _the **smallest numerically balanced** number
**strictly greater** than _`n` _._

**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 1
>
> Output: 22
>
> Explanation:
>
> 22 is numerically balanced since:
>
> - The digit 2 occurs 2 times.
>
> It is also the smallest numerically balanced number strictly greater than 1.

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 1000
>
> Output: 1333
>
> Explanation:
>
> 1333 is numerically balanced since:
>
> - The digit 1 occurs 1 time.
> - The digit 3 occurs 3 times.
>
> It is also the smallest numerically balanced number strictly greater than 1000.
>
> Note that 1022 cannot be the answer because 0 appeared more than 0 times.

**Example 3:**

> Input: n = 3000
>
> Output: 3133
>
> Explanation:
>
> 3133 is numerically balanced since:
>
> - The digit 1 occurs 1 time.
> - The digit 3 occurs 3 times.
>
> It is also the smallest numerically balanced number strictly greater than 3000.

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= n <= 10^6`
