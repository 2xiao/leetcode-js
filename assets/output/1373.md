# [1373. Maximum Sum BST in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-bst-in-binary-tree/)

## 题目

Given a **binary tree** `root`, return _the maximum sum of all keys of **any**
sub-tree which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST)_.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

**Example 1:**

> Input: root = [1,4,3,2,4,2,5,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,6]
>
> Output: 20
>
> Explanation: Maximum sum in a valid Binary search tree is obtained in root node with key equal to 3.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/30/sample_2_1709.png)

> Input: root = [4,3,null,1,2]
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: Maximum sum in a valid Binary search tree is obtained in a single root node with key equal to 2.

**Example 3:**

> Input: root = [-4,-2,-5]
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation: All values are negatives. Return an empty BST.

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 4 * 10^4]`.
- `-4 * 10^4 <= Node.val <= 4 * 10^4`
