# [1552. Magnetic Force Between Two Balls](https://leetcode.com/problems/magnetic-force-between-two-balls)

## 题目

In the universe Earth C-137, Rick discovered a special form of magnetic force
between two balls if they are put in his new invented basket. Rick has `n`
empty baskets, the `ith` basket is at `position[i]`, Morty has `m` balls and
needs to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the **minimum
magnetic force** between any two balls is **maximum**.

Rick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions `x`
and `y` is `|x - y|`.

Given the integer array `position` and the integer `m`. Return _the required
force_.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/11/q3v1.jpg)

> Input: position = [1,2,3,4,7], m = 3
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation: Distributing the 3 balls into baskets 1, 4 and 7 will make the magnetic force between ball pairs [3, 3, 6]. The minimum magnetic force is 3. We cannot achieve a larger minimum magnetic force than 3.

**Example 2:**

> Input: position = [5,4,3,2,1,1000000000], m = 2
> 
> Output: 999999999
> 
> Explanation: We can use baskets 1 and 1000000000.

**Constraints:**

  * `n == position.length`
  * `2 <= n <= 105`
  * `1 <= position[i] <= 109`
  * All integers in `position` are **distinct**.
  * `2 <= m <= position.length`
