# [2078. Two Furthest Houses With Different Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-furthest-houses-with-different-colors)

## 题目

There are `n` houses evenly lined up on the street, and each house is
beautifully painted. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `colors` of
length `n`, where `colors[i]` represents the color of the `ith` house.

Return _the **maximum** distance between **two** houses with **different**
colors_.

The distance between the `ith` and `jth` houses is `abs(i - j)`, where
`abs(x)` is the **absolute value** of `x`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: colors = [ _ **1**_ ,1,1, ** _6_** ,1,1,1]
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation: In the above image, color 1 is blue, and color 6 is red.
> 
> The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 3.
> 
> House 0 has color 1, and house 3 has color 6. The distance between them is abs(0 - 3) = 3.
> 
> Note that houses 3 and 6 can also produce the optimal answer.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/31/eg2.png)

> Input: colors = [ _ **1**_ ,8,3,8, _ **3**_ ]
> 
> Output: 4
> 
> Explanation: In the above image, color 1 is blue, color 8 is yellow, and color 3 is green.
> 
> The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 4.
> 
> House 0 has color 1, and house 4 has color 3. The distance between them is abs(0 - 4) = 4.

**Example 3:**

> Input: colors = [ _ **0**_ , ** _1_** ]
> 
> Output: 1
> 
> Explanation: The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 1.
> 
> House 0 has color 0, and house 1 has color 1. The distance between them is abs(0 - 1) = 1.

**Constraints:**

  * `n == colors.length`
  * `2 <= n <= 100`
  * `0 <= colors[i] <= 100`
  * Test data are generated such that **at least** two houses have different colors.
