# [2261. K Divisible Elements Subarrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-divisible-elements-subarrays)

## 题目

Given an integer array `nums` and two integers `k` and `p`, return _the number
of **distinct subarrays,** which have **at most**_ `k` _elements_ that are
_divisible by_ `p`.

Two arrays `nums1` and `nums2` are said to be **distinct** if:

  * They are of **different** lengths, or
  * There exists **at least** one index `i` where `nums1[i] != nums2[i]`.

A **subarray** is defined as a **non-empty** contiguous sequence of elements
in an array.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [ _ **2**_ ,3,3, _ **2**_ , _ **2**_ ], k = 2, p = 2
    **Output:** 11
    **Explanation:**
    The elements at indices 0, 3, and 4 are divisible by p = 2.
    The 11 distinct subarrays which have at most k = 2 elements divisible by 2 are:
    [2], [2,3], [2,3,3], [2,3,3,2], [3], [3,3], [3,3,2], [3,3,2,2], [3,2], [3,2,2], and [2,2].
    Note that the subarrays [2] and [3] occur more than once in nums, but they should each be counted only once.
    The subarray [2,3,3,2,2] should not be counted because it has 3 elements that are divisible by 2.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 4, p = 1
    **Output:** 10
    **Explanation:**
    All element of nums are divisible by p = 1.
    Also, every subarray of nums will have at most 4 elements that are divisible by 1.
    Since all subarrays are distinct, the total number of subarrays satisfying all the constraints is 10.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 200`
  * `1 <= nums[i], p <= 200`
  * `1 <= k <= nums.length`
