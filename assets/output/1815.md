# [1815. Maximum Number of Groups Getting Fresh Donuts](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-groups-getting-fresh-donuts)

## 题目

There is a donuts shop that bakes donuts in batches of `batchSize`. They have
a rule where they must serve **all** of the donuts of a batch before serving
any donuts of the next batch. You are given an integer `batchSize` and an
integer array `groups`, where `groups[i]` denotes that there is a group of
`groups[i]` customers that will visit the shop. Each customer will get exactly
one donut.

When a group visits the shop, all customers of the group must be served before
serving any of the following groups. A group will be happy if they all get
fresh donuts. That is, the first customer of the group does not receive a
donut that was left over from the previous group.

You can freely rearrange the ordering of the groups. Return _the **maximum**
possible number of happy groups after rearranging the groups._



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** batchSize = 3, groups = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** You can arrange the groups as [6,2,4,5,1,3]. Then the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 6th groups will be happy.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** batchSize = 4, groups = [1,3,2,5,2,2,1,6]
    **Output:** 4
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= batchSize <= 9`
  * `1 <= groups.length <= 30`
  * `1 <= groups[i] <= 109`
