# [1876. Substrings of Size Three with Distinct Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/substrings-of-size-three-with-distinct-characters/)

## 题目

A string is **good** if there are no repeated characters.

Given a string `s`​​​​​, return _the number of **good substrings** of length
**three** in _`s`​​​​​​.

Note that if there are multiple occurrences of the same substring, every
occurrence should be counted.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "xyzzaz"
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation: There are 4 substrings of size 3: "xyz", "yzz", "zza", and "zaz".
>
> The only good substring of length 3 is "xyz".

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "aababcabc"
>
> Output: 4
>
> Explanation: There are 7 substrings of size 3: "aab", "aba", "bab", "abc", "bca", "cab", and "abc".
>
> The good substrings are "abc", "bca", "cab", and "abc".

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s`​​​​​​ consists of lowercase English letters.
