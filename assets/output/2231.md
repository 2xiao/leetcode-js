# [2231. Largest Number After Digit Swaps by Parity](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number-after-digit-swaps-by-parity/)

## 题目

You are given a positive integer `num`. You may swap any two digits of `num`
that have the same **parity** (i.e. both odd digits or both even digits).

Return _the **largest** possible value of _`num` _after **any** number of
swaps._

**Example 1:**

> Input: num = 1234
>
> Output: 3412
>
> Explanation: Swap the digit 3 with the digit 1, this results in the number 3214.
>
> Swap the digit 2 with the digit 4, this results in the number 3412.
>
> Note that there may be other sequences of swaps but it can be shown that 3412 is the largest possible number.
>
> Also note that we may not swap the digit 4 with the digit 1 since they are of different parities.

**Example 2:**

> Input: num = 65875
>
> Output: 87655
>
> Explanation: Swap the digit 8 with the digit 6, this results in the number 85675.
>
> Swap the first digit 5 with the digit 7, this results in the number 87655.
>
> Note that there may be other sequences of swaps but it can be shown that 87655 is the largest possible number.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= num <= 10^9`
