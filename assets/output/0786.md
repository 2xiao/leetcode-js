# [786. K-th Smallest Prime Fraction](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-th-smallest-prime-fraction)

## 题目

You are given a sorted integer array `arr` containing `1` and **prime**
numbers, where all the integers of `arr` are unique. You are also given an
integer `k`.

For every `i` and `j` where `0 <= i < j < arr.length`, we consider the
fraction `arr[i] / arr[j]`.

Return _the_ `kth` _smallest fraction considered_. Return your answer as an
array of integers of size `2`, where `answer[0] == arr[i]` and `answer[1] ==
arr[j]`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: arr = [1,2,3,5], k = 3
> 
> Output: [2,5]
> 
> Explanation: The fractions to be considered in sorted order are:
> 
> 1/5, 1/3, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, and 2/3.
> 
> The third fraction is 2/5.

**Example 2:**

> Input: arr = [1,7], k = 1
> 
> Output: [1,7]

**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= arr.length <= 1000`
  * `1 <= arr[i] <= 3 * 104`
  * `arr[0] == 1`
  * `arr[i]` is a **prime** number for `i > 0`.
  * All the numbers of `arr` are **unique** and sorted in **strictly increasing** order.
  * `1 <= k <= arr.length * (arr.length - 1) / 2`



**Follow up:** Can you solve the problem with better than `O(n2)` complexity?
