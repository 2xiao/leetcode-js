# [1036. Escape a Large Maze](https://leetcode.com/problems/escape-a-large-maze/)

## 题目

There is a 1 million by 1 million grid on an XY-plane, and the coordinates of
each grid square are `(x, y)`.

We start at the `source = [sx, sy]` square and want to reach the `target =
[tx, ty]` square. There is also an array of `blocked` squares, where each
`blocked[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a blocked square with coordinates `(xi,
yi)`.

Each move, we can walk one square north, east, south, or west if the square is
**not** in the array of `blocked` squares. We are also not allowed to walk
outside of the grid.

Return `true` _if and only if it is possible to reach the_`target` _square
from the_`source` _square through a sequence of valid moves_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: blocked = [[0,1],[1,0]], source = [0,0], target = [0,2]
> 
> Output: false
> 
> Explanation: The target square is inaccessible starting from the source square because we cannot move.
> 
> We cannot move north or east because those squares are blocked.
> 
> We cannot move south or west because we cannot go outside of the grid.

**Example 2:**

> Input: blocked = [], source = [0,0], target = [999999,999999]
> 
> Output: true
> 
> Explanation: Because there are no blocked cells, it is possible to reach the target square.

**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= blocked.length <= 200`
  * `blocked[i].length == 2`
  * `0 <= xi, yi < 106`
  * `source.length == target.length == 2`
  * `0 <= sx, sy, tx, ty < 106`
  * `source != target`
  * It is guaranteed that `source` and `target` are not blocked.
