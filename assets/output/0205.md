# [205. Isomorphic Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/)

## 题目

Given two strings `s` and `t`, _determine if they are isomorphic_.

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be
replaced to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while
preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same
character, but a character may map to itself.

**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
>
> Output: true

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
>
> Output: false

**Example 3:**

> Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
>
> Output: true

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `t.length == s.length`
- `s` and `t` consist of any valid ascii character.
