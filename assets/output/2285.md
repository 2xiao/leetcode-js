# [2285. Maximum Total Importance of Roads](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-total-importance-of-roads/)

## 题目

You are given an integer `n` denoting the number of cities in a country. The
cities are numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are also given a 2D integer array `roads` where `roads[i] = [ai, bi]`
denotes that there exists a **bidirectional** road connecting cities `ai` and
`bi`.

You need to assign each city with an integer value from `1` to `n`, where each
value can only be used **once**. The **importance** of a road is then defined
as the **sum** of the values of the two cities it connects.

Return _the **maximum total importance** of all roads possible after assigning
the values optimally._

**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 5, roads = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[0,2],[1,3],[2,4]]
>
> Output: 43
>
> Explanation: The figure above shows the country and the assigned values of [2,4,5,3,1].
>
> - The road (0,1) has an importance of 2 + 4 = 6.
> - The road (1,2) has an importance of 4 + 5 = 9.
> - The road (2,3) has an importance of 5 + 3 = 8.
> - The road (0,2) has an importance of 2 + 5 = 7.
> - The road (1,3) has an importance of 4 + 3 = 7.
> - The road (2,4) has an importance of 5 + 1 = 6.
>
> The total importance of all roads is 6 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 7 + 6 = 43.
>
> It can be shown that we cannot obtain a greater total importance than 43.

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 5, roads = [[0,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
>
> Output: 20
>
> Explanation: The figure above shows the country and the assigned values of [4,3,2,5,1].
>
> - The road (0,3) has an importance of 4 + 5 = 9.
> - The road (2,4) has an importance of 2 + 1 = 3.
> - The road (1,3) has an importance of 3 + 5 = 8.
>
> The total importance of all roads is 9 + 3 + 8 = 20.
>
> It can be shown that we cannot obtain a greater total importance than 20.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
- `1 <= roads.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `roads[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1`
- `ai != bi`
- There are no duplicate roads.
