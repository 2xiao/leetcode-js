# [2226. Maximum Candies Allocated to K Children](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-candies-allocated-to-k-children)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `candies`. Each element in the
array denotes a pile of candies of size `candies[i]`. You can divide each pile
into any number of **sub piles** , but you **cannot** merge two piles
together.

You are also given an integer `k`. You should allocate piles of candies to `k`
children such that each child gets the **same** number of candies. Each child
can take **at most one** pile of candies and some piles of candies may go
unused.

Return _the **maximum number of candies** each child can get._



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** candies = [5,8,6], k = 3
    **Output:** 5
    **Explanation:** We can divide candies[1] into 2 piles of size 5 and 3, and candies[2] into 2 piles of size 5 and 1. We now have five piles of candies of sizes 5, 5, 3, 5, and 1. We can allocate the 3 piles of size 5 to 3 children. It can be proven that each child cannot receive more than 5 candies.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** candies = [2,5], k = 11
    **Output:** 0
    **Explanation:** There are 11 children but only 7 candies in total, so it is impossible to ensure each child receives at least one candy. Thus, each child gets no candy and the answer is 0.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= candies.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= candies[i] <= 107`
  * `1 <= k <= 1012`
