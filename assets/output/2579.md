# [2579. Count Total Number of Colored Cells](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-total-number-of-colored-cells/)

## 题目

There exists an infinitely large two-dimensional grid of uncolored unit cells.
You are given a positive integer `n`, indicating that you must do the
following routine for `n` minutes:

- At the first minute, color **any** arbitrary unit cell blue.
- Every minute thereafter, color blue **every** uncolored cell that touches a blue cell.

Below is a pictorial representation of the state of the grid after minutes 1,
2, and 3.

Return _the number of **colored cells** at the end of _`n` _minutes_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 1
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation: After 1 minute, there is only 1 blue cell, so we return 1.

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 2
>
> Output: 5
>
> Explanation: After 2 minutes, there are 4 colored cells on the boundary and 1 in the center, so we return 5.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
