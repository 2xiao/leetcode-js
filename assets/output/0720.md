# [720. Longest Word in Dictionary](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-word-in-dictionary)

## 题目

Given an array of strings `words` representing an English Dictionary, return
_the longest word in_ `words` _that can be built one character at a time by
other words in_ `words`.

If there is more than one possible answer, return the longest word with the
smallest lexicographical order. If there is no answer, return the empty
string.

Note that the word should be built from left to right with each additional
character being added to the end of a previous word.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** words = ["w","wo","wor","worl","world"]
    **Output:** "world"
    **Explanation:** The word "world" can be built one character at a time by "w", "wo", "wor", and "worl".
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** words = ["a","banana","app","appl","ap","apply","apple"]
    **Output:** "apple"
    **Explanation:** Both "apply" and "apple" can be built from other words in the dictionary. However, "apple" is lexicographically smaller than "apply".
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
  * `1 <= words[i].length <= 30`
  * `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
