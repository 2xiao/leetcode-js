# [1222. Queens That Can Attack the King](https://leetcode.com/problems/queens-that-can-attack-the-king/)

## 题目

On a **0-indexed** `8 x 8` chessboard, there can be multiple black queens ad
one white king.

You are given a 2D integer array `queens` where `queens[i] = [xQueeni,
yQueeni]` represents the position of the `ith` black queen on the chessboard.
You are also given an integer array `king` of length `2` where `king = [xKing,
yKing]` represents the position of the white king.

Return _the coordinates of the black queens that can directly attack the
king_. You may return the answer in **any order**.



**Example 1:**

> Input: queens = [[0,1],[1,0],[4,0],[0,4],[3,3],[2,4]], king = [0,0]
> 
> Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[3,3]]
> 
> Explanation: The diagram above shows the three queens that can directly attack the king and the three queens that cannot attack the king (i.e., marked with red dashes).

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/12/21/chess2.jpg)

> Input: queens = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,2],[3,4],[3,5],[4,4],[4,5]], king = [3,3]
> 
> Output: [[2,2],[3,4],[4,4]]
> 
> Explanation: The diagram above shows the three queens that can directly attack the king and the three queens that cannot attack the king (i.e., marked with red dashes).

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= queens.length < 64`
  * `queens[i].length == king.length == 2`
  * `0 <= xQueeni, yQueeni, xKing, yKing < 8`
  * All the given positions are **unique**.
