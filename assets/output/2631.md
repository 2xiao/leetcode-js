# [2631. Group By](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-by/)

## 题目

Write code that enhances all arrays such that you can call the
`array.groupBy(fn)` method on any array and it will return a **grouped**
version of the array.

A **grouped** array is an object where each key is the output of
`fn(arr[i])` and each value is an array containing all items in the original
array with that key.

The provided callback `fn` will accept an item in the array and return a
string key.

The order of each value list should be the order the items appear in the
array. Any order of keys is acceptable.

Please solve it without lodash's `_.groupBy` function.

**Example 1:**

> Input:
>
> array = [
>
> {"id":"1"},
>
> {"id":"1"},
>
> {"id":"2"}
>
> ],
>
> fn = function (item) {
>
> return item.id;
>
> }
>
> Output:
>
> {
>
> "1": [{"id": "1"}, {"id": "1"}],
>
> "2": [{"id": "2"}]
>
> }
>
> Explanation:
>
> Output is from array.groupBy(fn).
>
> The selector function gets the "id" out of each item in the array.
>
> There are two objects with an "id" of 1. Both of those objects are put in the first array.
>
> There is one object with an "id" of 2. That object is put in the second array.

**Example 2:**

> Input:
>
> array = [
>
> [1, 2, 3],
>
> [1, 3, 5],
>
> [1, 5, 9]
>
> ]
>
> fn = function (list) {
>
> return String(list[0]);
>
> }
>
> Output:
>
> {
>
> "1": [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 5], [1, 5, 9]]
>
> }
>
> Explanation:
>
> The array can be of any type. In this case, the selector function defines the key as being the first element in the array.
>
> All the arrays have 1 as their first element so they are grouped together.
>
> {
>
> "1": [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 5], [1, 5, 9]]
>
> }

**Example 3:**

> Input:
>
> array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
>
> fn = function (n) {
>
> return String(n > 5);
>
> }
>
> Output:
>
> {
>
> "true": [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
>
> "false": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>
> }
>
> Explanation:
>
> The selector function splits the array by whether each number is greater than 5.

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= array.length <= 10^5`
- `fn` returns a string
