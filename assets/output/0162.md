# [162. Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element)

## 题目

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return
its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of
the peaks**.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞`. In other words, an element is
always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the
array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.



**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
> 
> Output: 5
> 
> Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
  * `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
  * `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all valid `i`.
