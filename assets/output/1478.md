# [1478. Allocate Mailboxes](https://leetcode.com/problems/allocate-mailboxes)

## 题目

Given the array `houses` where `houses[i]` is the location of the `ith` house
along a street and an integer `k`, allocate `k` mailboxes in the street.

Return _the **minimum** total distance between each house and its nearest
mailbox_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** houses = [1,4,8,10,20], k = 3
    **Output:** 5
    **Explanation:** Allocate mailboxes in position 3, 9 and 20.
    Minimum total distance from each houses to nearest mailboxes is |3-1| + |4-3| + |9-8| + |10-9| + |20-20| = 5 
    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/05/07/sample_2_1816.png)

    
    
    **Input:** houses = [2,3,5,12,18], k = 2
    **Output:** 9
    **Explanation:** Allocate mailboxes in position 3 and 14.
    Minimum total distance from each houses to nearest mailboxes is |2-3| + |3-3| + |5-3| + |12-14| + |18-14| = 9.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= k <= houses.length <= 100`
  * `1 <= houses[i] <= 104`
  * All the integers of `houses` are **unique**.
