# [2368. Reachable Nodes With Restrictions](https://leetcode.com/problems/reachable-nodes-with-restrictions)

## 题目

There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and `n
- 1` edges.

You are given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1` where `edges[i] =
[ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the
tree. You are also given an integer array `restricted` which represents
**restricted** nodes.

Return _the **maximum** number of nodes you can reach from node _`0` _without
visiting a restricted node._

Note that node `0` will **not** be a restricted node.



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[3,1],[4,0],[0,5],[5,6]], restricted = [4,5]
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** The diagram above shows the tree.
    We have that [0,1,2,3] are the only nodes that can be reached from node 0 without visiting a restricted node.
    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/06/15/ex2drawio.png)

    
    
    **Input:** n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,5],[0,4],[3,2],[6,5]], restricted = [4,2,1]
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** The diagram above shows the tree.
    We have that [0,5,6] are the only nodes that can be reached from node 0 without visiting a restricted node.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= n <= 105`
  * `edges.length == n - 1`
  * `edges[i].length == 2`
  * `0 <= ai, bi < n`
  * `ai != bi`
  * `edges` represents a valid tree.
  * `1 <= restricted.length < n`
  * `1 <= restricted[i] < n`
  * All the values of `restricted` are **unique**.
