# [2696. Minimum String Length After Removing Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-string-length-after-removing-substrings/)

## 题目

You are given a string `s` consisting only of **uppercase** English letters.

You can apply some operations to this string where, in one operation, you can
remove **any** occurrence of one of the substrings `"AB"` or `"CD"` from `s`.

Return _the **minimum** possible length of the resulting string that you can
obtain_.

**Note** that the string concatenates after removing the substring and could
produce new `"AB"` or `"CD"` substrings.

**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "ABFCACDB"
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: We can do the following operations:
>
> - Remove the substring " _AB_ FCACDB", so s = "FCACDB".
> - Remove the substring "FCA _CD_ B", so s = "FCAB".
> - Remove the substring "FC _AB_ ", so s = "FC".
>
> So the resulting length of the string is 2.
>
> It can be shown that it is the minimum length that we can obtain.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "ACBBD"
>
> Output: 5
>
> Explanation: We cannot do any operations on the string so the length remains the same.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s` consists only of uppercase English letters.
