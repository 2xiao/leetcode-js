# [2578. Split With Minimum Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-with-minimum-sum/)

## 题目

Given a positive integer `num`, split it into two non-negative integers `num1`
and `num2` such that:

- The concatenation of `num1` and `num2` is a permutation of `num`.
  > - In other words, the sum of the number of occurrences of each digit in `num1` and `num2` is equal to the number of occurrences of that digit in `num`.
- `num1` and `num2` can contain leading zeros.

Return _the **minimum** possible sum of_ `num1` _and_ `num2`.

**Notes:**

- It is guaranteed that `num` does not contain any leading zeros.
- The order of occurrence of the digits in `num1` and `num2` may differ from the order of occurrence of `num`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: num = 4325
>
> Output: 59
>
> Explanation: We can split 4325 so that num1 is 24 and num2 is 35, giving a sum of 59. We can prove that 59 is indeed the minimal possible sum.

**Example 2:**

> Input: num = 687
>
> Output: 75
>
> Explanation: We can split 687 so that num1 is 68 and num2 is 7, which would give an optimal sum of 75.

**Constraints:**

- `10 <= num <= 10^9`
