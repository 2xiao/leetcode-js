# [2966. Divide Array Into Arrays With Max Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-array-into-arrays-with-max-difference/)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `nums` of size `n` where `n` is a multiple of 3
and a positive integer `k`.

Divide the array `nums` into `n / 3` arrays of size **3** satisfying the
following condition:

- The difference between **any** two elements in one array is **less than or equal** to `k`.

Return a **2D** array containing the arrays. If it is impossible to satisfy
the conditions, return an empty array. And if there are multiple answers,
return **any** of them.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,3,4,8,7,9,3,5,1], k = 2

**Output:** [[1,1,3],[3,4,5],[7,8,9]]

**Explanation:**

The difference between any two elements in each array is less than or equal to 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2,4,2,2,5,2], k = 2

**Output:** []

**Explanation:**

Different ways to divide `nums` into 2 arrays of size 3 are:

- [[2,2,2],[2,4,5]] (and its permutations)
- [[2,2,4],[2,2,5]] (and its permutations)

Because there are four 2s there will be an array with the elements 2 and 5 no
matter how we divide it. since `5 - 2 = 3 > k`, the condition is not satisfied
and so there is no valid division.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [4,2,9,8,2,12,7,12,10,5,8,5,5,7,9,2,5,11], k = 14

**Output:** [[2,2,12],[4,8,5],[5,9,7],[7,8,5],[5,9,10],[11,12,2]]

**Explanation:**

The difference between any two elements in each array is less than or equal to 14.

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `n `is a multiple of 3
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= k <= 10^5`
