# [1584. Min Cost to Connect All Points](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-to-connect-all-points)

## 题目

You are given an array `points` representing integer coordinates of some
points on a 2D-plane, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`.

The cost of connecting two points `[xi, yi]` and `[xj, yj]` is the **manhattan
distance** between them: `|xi - xj| + |yi - yj|`, where `|val|` denotes the
absolute value of `val`.

Return _the minimum cost to make all points connected._ All points are
connected if there is **exactly one** simple path between any two points.



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]]
    **Output:** 20
    **Explanation:** 
    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/26/c.png)
    We can connect the points as shown above to get the minimum cost of 20.
    Notice that there is a unique path between every pair of points.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** points = [[3,12],[-2,5],[-4,1]]
    **Output:** 18
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= points.length <= 1000`
  * `-106 <= xi, yi <= 106`
  * All pairs `(xi, yi)` are distinct.
