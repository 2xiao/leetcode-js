# [1269. Number of Ways to Stay in the Same Place After Some Steps](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-stay-in-the-same-place-after-some-steps/)

## 题目

You have a pointer at index `0` in an array of size `arrLen`. At each step,
you can move 1 position to the left, 1 position to the right in the array, or
stay in the same place (The pointer should not be placed outside the array at
any time).

Given two integers `steps` and `arrLen`, return the number of ways such that
your pointer is still at index `0` after **exactly** `steps` steps. Since the
answer may be too large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: steps = 3, arrLen = 2
>
> Output: 4
>
> Explanation: There are 4 differents ways to stay at index 0 after 3 steps.
>
> Right, Left, Stay
>
> Stay, Right, Left
>
> Right, Stay, Left
>
> Stay, Stay, Stay

**Example 2:**

> Input: steps = 2, arrLen = 4
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: There are 2 differents ways to stay at index 0 after 2 steps
>
> Right, Left
>
> Stay, Stay

**Example 3:**

> Input: steps = 4, arrLen = 2
>
> Output: 8

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= steps <= 500`
- `1 <= arrLen <= 10^6`
