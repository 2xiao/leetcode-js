# [2508. Add Edges to Make Degrees of All Nodes Even](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-edges-to-make-degrees-of-all-nodes-even)

## 题目

There is an **undirected** graph consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `1` to
`n`. You are given the integer `n` and a **2D** array `edges` where `edges[i]
= [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi`. The
graph can be disconnected.

You can add **at most** two additional edges (possibly none) to this graph so
that there are no repeated edges and no self-loops.

Return `true` _if it is possible to make the degree of each node in the graph
even, otherwise return_`false` _._

The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.



**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 5, edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,2],[1,4],[2,5]]
> 
> Output: true
> 
> Explanation: The above diagram shows a valid way of adding an edge.
> 
> Every node in the resulting graph is connected to an even number of edges.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/26/aagraphdrawio.png)

> Input: n = 4, edges = [[1,2],[3,4]]
> 
> Output: true
> 
> Explanation: The above diagram shows a valid way of adding two edges.

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/26/aaagraphdrawio.png)

> Input: n = 4, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4]]
> 
> Output: false
> 
> Explanation: It is not possible to obtain a valid graph with adding at most 2 edges.



**Constraints:**

  * `3 <= n <= 105`
  * `2 <= edges.length <= 105`
  * `edges[i].length == 2`
  * `1 <= ai, bi <= n`
  * `ai != bi`
  * There are no repeated edges.
