# [3091. Apply Operations to Make Sum of Array Greater Than or Equal to k](https://leetcode.com/problems/apply-operations-to-make-sum-of-array-greater-than-or-equal-to-k/)

## 题目

You are given a **positive** integer `k`. Initially, you have an array `nums =
[1]`.

You can perform **any** of the following operations on the array **any**
number of times (**possibly zero**):

- Choose any element in the array and **increase** its value by `1`.
- Duplicate any element in the array and add it to the end of the array.

Return _the**minimum** number of operations required to make the **sum** of
elements of the final array greater than or equal to _`k`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** k = 11

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:**

We can do the following operations on the array `nums = [1]`:

- Increase the element by `1` three times. The resulting array is `nums = [4]`.
- Duplicate the element two times. The resulting array is `nums = [4,4,4]`.

The sum of the final array is `4 + 4 + 4 = 12` which is greater than or equal
to `k = 11`.  
The total number of operations performed is `3 + 2 = 5`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** k = 1

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

The sum of the original array is already greater than or equal to `1`, so no
operations are needed.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= 10^5`
