## 题目

You are given an `8 x 8` **matrix** representing a chessboard. There is
**exactly one** white rook represented by `'R'`, some number of white bishops
`'B'`, and some number of black pawns `'p'`. Empty squares are represented by
`'.'`.

A rook can move any number of squares horizontally or vertically (up, down,
left, right) until it reaches another piece _or_ the edge of the board. A rook
is **attacking** a pawn if it can move to the pawn's square in one move.

Note: A rook cannot move through other pieces, such as bishops or pawns. This
means a rook cannot attack a pawn if there is another piece blocking the path.

Return the **number of pawns** the white rook is **attacking**.



**Example 1:**

**Input:** board =
[[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".","p",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".","R",".",".",".","p"],[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".","p",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."]]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

In this example, the rook is attacking all the pawns.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board =
[[".",".",".",".",".",".","."],[".","p","p","p","p","p",".","."],[".","p","p","B","p","p",".","."],[".","p","B","R","B","p",".","."],[".","p","p","B","p","p",".","."],[".","p","p","p","p","p",".","."],[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."]]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

The bishops are blocking the rook from attacking any of the pawns.

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/20/1253_example_3_improved.PNG)

**Input:** board =
[[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".","p",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".","p",".",".",".","."],["p","p",".","R",".","p","B","."],[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".","B",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".","p",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."]]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

The rook is attacking the pawns at positions b5, d6, and f5.



**Constraints:**

  * `board.length == 8`
  * `board[i].length == 8`
  * `board[i][j]` is either `'R'`, `'.'`, `'B'`, or `'p'`
  * There is exactly one cell with `board[i][j] == 'R'`


## 题目大意

给定一个 `8 x 8` 的棋盘，**只有一个** 白色的车，用字符 `'R'` 表示。棋盘上还可能存在白色的象 `'B'` 以及黑色的卒
`'p'`。空方块用字符 `'.'` 表示。

车可以按水平或竖直方向（上，下，左，右）移动任意个方格直到它遇到另一个棋子或棋盘的边界。如果它能够在一次移动中移动到棋子的方格，则能够 **吃掉** 棋子。

注意：车不能穿过其它棋子，比如象和卒。这意味着如果有其它棋子挡住了路径，车就不能够吃掉棋子。

返回白车将能 **吃掉** 的 **卒的数量** 。

**提示：**

  1. `board.length == 8`
  2. `board[i].length == 8`
  3. `board[i][j]` 可以是 `'R'`，`'.'`，`'B'` 或 `'p'`
  4. 只有一个格子上存在 `board[i][j] == 'R'`
