# [1743. Restore the Array From Adjacent Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/restore-the-array-from-adjacent-pairs/)

## 题目

There is an integer array `nums` that consists of `n` **unique** elements, but
you have forgotten it. However, you do remember every pair of adjacent
elements in `nums`.

You are given a 2D integer array `adjacentPairs` of size `n - 1` where each
`adjacentPairs[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates that the elements `ui` and `vi` are
adjacent in `nums`.

It is guaranteed that every adjacent pair of elements `nums[i]` and
`nums[i+1]` will exist in `adjacentPairs`, either as `[nums[i], nums[i+1]]` or
`[nums[i+1], nums[i]]`. The pairs can appear **in any order**.

Return _the original array_`nums` _. If there are multiple solutions, return
**any of them**_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: adjacentPairs = [[2,1],[3,4],[3,2]]
>
> Output: [1,2,3,4]
>
> Explanation: This array has all its adjacent pairs in adjacentPairs.
>
> Notice that adjacentPairs[i] may not be in left-to-right order.

**Example 2:**

> Input: adjacentPairs = [[4,-2],[1,4],[-3,1]]
>
> Output: [-2,4,1,-3]
>
> Explanation: There can be negative numbers.
>
> Another solution is [-3,1,4,-2], which would also be accepted.

**Example 3:**

> Input: adjacentPairs = [[100000,-100000]]
>
> Output: [100000,-100000]

**Constraints:**

- `nums.length == n`
- `adjacentPairs.length == n - 1`
- `adjacentPairs[i].length == 2`
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `-10^5 <= nums[i], ui, vi <= 10^5`
- There exists some `nums` that has `adjacentPairs` as its pairs.
