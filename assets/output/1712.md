# [1712. Ways to Split Array Into Three Subarrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/ways-to-split-array-into-three-subarrays/)

## 题目

A split of an integer array is **good** if:

- The array is split into three **non-empty** contiguous subarrays - named `left`, `mid`, `right` respectively from left to right.
- The sum of the elements in `left` is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in `mid`, and the sum of the elements in `mid` is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in `right`.

Given `nums`, an array of **non-negative** integers, return _the number of
**good** ways to split_ `nums`. As the number may be too large, return it
**modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [1,1,1]
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation: The only good way to split nums is [1] [1] [1].

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [1,2,2,2,5,0]
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: There are three good ways of splitting nums:
>
> [1] [2] [2,2,5,0]
>
> [1] [2,2] [2,5,0]
>
> [1,2] [2,2] [5,0]

**Example 3:**

> Input: nums = [3,2,1]
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation: There is no good way to split nums.

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
