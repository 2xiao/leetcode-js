# [16. 3Sum Closest](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/)

## 题目

Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `target`, find
three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`.

Return _the sum of the three integers_.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= nums.length <= 500`
- `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `-10^4 <= target <= 10^4`
