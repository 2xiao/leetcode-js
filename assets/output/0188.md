# [188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a
given stock on the `ith` day, and an integer `k`.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most `k`
transactions: i.e. you may buy at most `k` times and sell at most `k` times.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e.,
you must sell the stock before you buy again).



**Example 1:**

> Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.

**Example 2:**

> Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
> 
> Output: 7
> 
> Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= k <= 100`
  * `1 <= prices.length <= 1000`
  * `0 <= prices[i] <= 1000`
