# [1343. Number of Sub-arrays of Size K and Average Greater than or Equal to Threshold](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-sub-arrays-of-size-k-and-average-greater-than-or-equal-to-threshold)

## 题目

Given an array of integers `arr` and two integers `k` and `threshold`, return
_the number of sub-arrays of size_`k` _and average greater than or equal
to_`threshold`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** arr = [2,2,2,2,5,5,5,8], k = 3, threshold = 4
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** Sub-arrays [2,5,5],[5,5,5] and [5,5,8] have averages 4, 5 and 6 respectively. All other sub-arrays of size 3 have averages less than 4 (the threshold).
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** arr = [11,13,17,23,29,31,7,5,2,3], k = 3, threshold = 5
    **Output:** 6
    **Explanation:** The first 6 sub-arrays of size 3 have averages greater than 5. Note that averages are not integers.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= arr.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= arr[i] <= 104`
  * `1 <= k <= arr.length`
  * `0 <= threshold <= 104`
