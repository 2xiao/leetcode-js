# [2463. Minimum Total Distance Traveled](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-total-distance-traveled)

## 题目

There are some robots and factories on the X-axis. You are given an integer
array `robot` where `robot[i]` is the position of the `ith` robot. You are
also given a 2D integer array `factory` where `factory[j] = [positionj,
limitj]` indicates that `positionj` is the position of the `jth` factory and
that the `jth` factory can repair at most `limitj` robots.

The positions of each robot are **unique**. The positions of each factory are
also **unique**. Note that a robot can be **in the same position** as a
factory initially.

All the robots are initially broken; they keep moving in one direction. The
direction could be the negative or the positive direction of the X-axis. When
a robot reaches a factory that did not reach its limit, the factory repairs
the robot, and it stops moving.

**At any moment** , you can set the initial direction of moving for **some**
robot. Your target is to minimize the total distance traveled by all the
robots.

Return _the minimum total distance traveled by all the robots_. The test cases
are generated such that all the robots can be repaired.

**Note that**

  * All robots move at the same speed.
  * If two robots move in the same direction, they will never collide.
  * If two robots move in opposite directions and they meet at some point, they do not collide. They cross each other.
  * If a robot passes by a factory that reached its limits, it crosses it as if it does not exist.
  * If the robot moved from a position `x` to a position `y`, the distance it moved is `|y - x|`.



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** robot = [0,4,6], factory = [[2,2],[6,2]]
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** As shown in the figure:
    - The first robot at position 0 moves in the positive direction. It will be repaired at the first factory.
    - The second robot at position 4 moves in the negative direction. It will be repaired at the first factory.
    - The third robot at position 6 will be repaired at the second factory. It does not need to move.
    The limit of the first factory is 2, and it fixed 2 robots.
    The limit of the second factory is 2, and it fixed 1 robot.
    The total distance is |2 - 0| + |2 - 4| + |6 - 6| = 4. It can be shown that we cannot achieve a better total distance than 4.
    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/09/15/example-2.jpg)

    
    
    **Input:** robot = [1,-1], factory = [[-2,1],[2,1]]
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** As shown in the figure:
    - The first robot at position 1 moves in the positive direction. It will be repaired at the second factory.
    - The second robot at position -1 moves in the negative direction. It will be repaired at the first factory.
    The limit of the first factory is 1, and it fixed 1 robot.
    The limit of the second factory is 1, and it fixed 1 robot.
    The total distance is |2 - 1| + |(-2) - (-1)| = 2. It can be shown that we cannot achieve a better total distance than 2.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= robot.length, factory.length <= 100`
  * `factory[j].length == 2`
  * `-109 <= robot[i], positionj <= 109`
  * `0 <= limitj <= robot.length`
  * The input will be generated such that it is always possible to repair every robot.
