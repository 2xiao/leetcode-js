# [2558. Take Gifts From the Richest Pile](https://leetcode.com/problems/take-gifts-from-the-richest-pile)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `gifts` denoting the number of gifts in various
piles. Every second, you do the following:

  * Choose the pile with the maximum number of gifts.
  * If there is more than one pile with the maximum number of gifts, choose any.
  * Leave behind the floor of the square root of the number of gifts in the pile. Take the rest of the gifts.

Return _the number of gifts remaining after_`k` _seconds._



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** gifts = [25,64,9,4,100], k = 4
    **Output:** 29
    **Explanation:** 
    The gifts are taken in the following way:
    - In the first second, the last pile is chosen and 10 gifts are left behind.
    - Then the second pile is chosen and 8 gifts are left behind.
    - After that the first pile is chosen and 5 gifts are left behind.
    - Finally, the last pile is chosen again and 3 gifts are left behind.
    The final remaining gifts are [5,8,9,4,3], so the total number of gifts remaining is 29.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** gifts = [1,1,1,1], k = 4
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** 
    In this case, regardless which pile you choose, you have to leave behind 1 gift in each pile. 
    That is, you can't take any pile with you. 
    So, the total gifts remaining are 4.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= gifts.length <= 103`
  * `1 <= gifts[i] <= 109`
  * `1 <= k <= 103`
