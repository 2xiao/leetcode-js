# [2598. Smallest Missing Non-negative Integer After Operations](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-missing-non-negative-integer-after-operations/)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `value`.

In one operation, you can add or subtract `value` from any element of `nums`.

- For example, if `nums = [1,2,3]` and `value = 2`, you can choose to subtract `value` from `nums[0]` to make `nums = [-1,2,3]`.

The MEX (minimum excluded) of an array is the smallest missing **non-
negative** integer in it.

- For example, the MEX of `[-1,2,3]` is `0` while the MEX of `[1,0,3]` is `2`.

Return _the maximum MEX of_`nums` _after applying the mentioned operation
**any number of times**_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [1,-10,7,13,6,8], value = 5
>
> Output: 4
>
> Explanation: One can achieve this result by applying the following operations:
>
> - Add value to nums[1] twice to make nums = [1, ** _0_** ,7,13,6,8]
> - Subtract value from nums[2] once to make nums = [1,0, ** _2_** ,13,6,8]
> - Subtract value from nums[3] twice to make nums = [1,0,2, ** _3_** ,6,8]
>
> The MEX of nums is 4. It can be shown that 4 is the maximum MEX we can achieve.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [1,-10,7,13,6,8], value = 7
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: One can achieve this result by applying the following operation:
>
> - subtract value from nums[2] once to make nums = [1,-10, _ **0**_ ,13,6,8]
>
> The MEX of nums is 2. It can be shown that 2 is the maximum MEX we can achieve.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length, value <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
