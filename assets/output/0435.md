# [435. Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/)

## 题目

Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`,
return _the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of
the intervals non-overlapping_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.

**Example 2:**

> Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

**Example 3:**

> Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `-5 * 10^4 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 10^4`
