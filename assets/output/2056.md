# [2056. Number of Valid Move Combinations On Chessboard](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-valid-move-combinations-on-chessboard/)

## 题目

There is an `8 x 8` chessboard containing `n` pieces (rooks, queens, or
bishops). You are given a string array `pieces` of length `n`, where
`pieces[i]` describes the type (rook, queen, or bishop) of the `ith` piece. In
addition, you are given a 2D integer array `positions` also of length `n`,
where `positions[i] = [ri, ci]` indicates that the `ith` piece is currently at
the **1-based** coordinate `(ri, ci)` on the chessboard.

When making a **move** for a piece, you choose a **destination** square that
the piece will travel toward and stop on.

  * A rook can only travel **horizontally or vertically** from `(r, c)` to the direction of `(r+1, c)`, `(r-1, c)`, `(r, c+1)`, or `(r, c-1)`.
  * A queen can only travel **horizontally, vertically, or diagonally** from `(r, c)` to the direction of `(r+1, c)`, `(r-1, c)`, `(r, c+1)`, `(r, c-1)`, `(r+1, c+1)`, `(r+1, c-1)`, `(r-1, c+1)`, `(r-1, c-1)`.
  * A bishop can only travel **diagonally** from `(r, c)` to the direction of `(r+1, c+1)`, `(r+1, c-1)`, `(r-1, c+1)`, `(r-1, c-1)`.

You must make a **move** for every piece on the board simultaneously. A **move
combination** consists of all the **moves** performed on all the given pieces.
Every second, each piece will instantaneously travel **one square** towards
their destination if they are not already at it. All pieces start traveling at
the `0th` second. A move combination is **invalid** if, at a given time, **two
or more** pieces occupy the same square.

Return _the number of **valid** move combinations_​​​​​.

**Notes:**

  * **No two pieces** will start in the **same** square.
  * You may choose the square a piece is already on as its **destination**.
  * If two pieces are **directly adjacent** to each other, it is valid for them to **move past each other** and swap positions in one second.



**Example 1:**

> Input: pieces = ["rook"], positions = [[1,1]]
> 
> Output: 15
> 
> Explanation: The image above shows the possible squares the piece can move to.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/23/a2.png)

> Input: pieces = ["queen"], positions = [[1,1]]
> 
> Output: 22
> 
> Explanation: The image above shows the possible squares the piece can move to.

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/23/a3.png)

> Input: pieces = ["bishop"], positions = [[4,3]]
> 
> Output: 12
> 
> Explanation: The image above shows the possible squares the piece can move to.

**Constraints:**

  * `n == pieces.length `
  * `n == positions.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 4`
  * `pieces` only contains the strings `"rook"`, `"queen"`, and `"bishop"`.
  * There will be at most one queen on the chessboard.
  * `1 <= xi, yi <= 8`
  * Each `positions[i]` is distinct.
