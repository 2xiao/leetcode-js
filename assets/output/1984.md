# [1984. Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difference-between-highest-and-lowest-of-k-scores)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` represents
the score of the `ith` student. You are also given an integer `k`.

Pick the scores of any `k` students from the array so that the **difference**
between the **highest** and the **lowest** of the `k` scores is **minimized**.

Return _the **minimum** possible difference_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [90], k = 1
    **Output:** 0
    **Explanation:** There is one way to pick score(s) of one student:
    - [ ** _90_** ]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 90 - 90 = 0.
    The minimum possible difference is 0.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [9,4,1,7], k = 2
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** There are six ways to pick score(s) of two students:
    - [ ** _9_** , ** _4_** ,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 4 = 5.
    - [ ** _9_** ,4, ** _1_** ,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 1 = 8.
    - [ ** _9_** ,4,1, ** _7_** ]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 7 = 2.
    - [9, ** _4_** , ** _1_** ,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 4 - 1 = 3.
    - [9, ** _4_** ,1, ** _7_** ]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 4 = 3.
    - [9,4, ** _1_** , ** _7_** ]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 1 = 6.
    The minimum possible difference is 2.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 1000`
  * `0 <= nums[i] <= 105`
