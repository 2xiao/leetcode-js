# [322. Coin Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different
denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return _the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount_. If
that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return
`-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** coins = [2], amount = 3
    **Output:** -1
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** coins = [1], amount = 0
    **Output:** 0
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= coins.length <= 12`
  * `1 <= coins[i] <= 231 - 1`
  * `0 <= amount <= 104`
