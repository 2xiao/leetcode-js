## 题目

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land)
and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent
lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid
are all surrounded by water.



**Example 1:**

> Input: grid = [
> 
>   ["1","1","1","1","0"],
> 
>   ["1","1","0","1","0"],
> 
>   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
> 
>   ["0","0","0","0","0"]
> 
> ]
> 
> Output: 1

**Example 2:**

> Input: grid = [
> 
>   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
> 
>   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
> 
>   ["0","0","1","0","0"],
> 
>   ["0","0","0","1","1"]
> 
> ]
> 
> Output: 3

**Constraints:**

  * `m == grid.length`
  * `n == grid[i].length`
  * `1 <= m, n <= 300`
  * `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.


## 题目大意

给你一个由 `'1'`（陆地）和 `'0'`（水）组成的的二维网格，请你计算网格中岛屿的数量。

岛屿总是被水包围，并且每座岛屿只能由水平方向和/或竖直方向上相邻的陆地连接形成。

此外，你可以假设该网格的四条边均被水包围。

**示例 1：**

> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> **输入：** grid = [
> 
>   ["1","1","1","1","0"],
> 
>   ["1","1","0","1","0"],
> 
>   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
> 
>   ["0","0","0","0","0"]
> 
> ]
> 
> **输出：** 1
> 
> 

**示例 2：**

> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> **输入：** grid = [
> 
>   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
> 
>   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
> 
>   ["0","0","1","0","0"],
> 
>   ["0","0","0","1","1"]
> 
> ]
> 
> **输出：** 3
> 
> 

**提示：**

  * `m == grid.length`
  * `n == grid[i].length`
  * `1 <= m, n <= 300`
  * `grid[i][j]` 的值为 `'0'` 或 `'1'`
