# [3238. Find the Number of Winning Players](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-number-of-winning-players/)

## 题目

You are given an integer `n` representing the number of players in a game and
a 2D array `pick` where `pick[i] = [xi, yi]` represents that the player `xi`
picked a ball of color `yi`.

Player `i` **wins** the game if they pick **strictly more** than `i` balls of
the **same** color. In other words,

- Player 0 wins if they pick any ball.
- Player 1 wins if they pick at least two balls of the _same_ color.
- ...
- Player `i` wins if they pick at least`i + 1` balls of the _same_ color.

Return the number of players who **win** the game.

**Note** that _multiple_ players can win the game.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4, pick = [[0,0],[1,0],[1,0],[2,1],[2,1],[2,0]]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

Player 0 and player 1 win the game, while players 2 and 3 do not win.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 5, pick = [[1,1],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4]]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

No player wins the game.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 5, pick = [[1,1],[2,4],[2,4],[2,4]]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

Player 2 wins the game by picking 3 balls with color 4.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 10`
- `1 <= pick.length <= 100`
- `pick[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= xi <= n - 1 `
- `0 <= yi <= 10`
