# [3108. Minimum Cost Walk in Weighted Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-walk-in-weighted-graph/)

## 题目

There is an undirected weighted graph with `n` vertices labeled from `0` to `n

- 1`.

You are given the integer `n` and an array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi,
wi]` indicates that there is an edge between vertices `ui` and `vi` with a
weight of `wi`.

A walk on a graph is a sequence of vertices and edges. The walk starts and
ends with a vertex, and each edge connects the vertex that comes before it and
the vertex that comes after it. It's important to note that a walk may visit
the same edge or vertex more than once.

The **cost** of a walk starting at node `u` and ending at node `v` is defined
as the bitwise `AND` of the weights of the edges traversed during the walk. In
other words, if the sequence of edge weights encountered during the walk is
`w0, w1, w2, ..., wk`, then the cost is calculated as `w0 & w1 & w2 & ... &
wk`, where `&` denotes the bitwise `AND` operator.

You are also given a 2D array `query`, where `query[i] = [si, ti]`. For each
query, you need to find the minimum cost of the walk starting at vertex `si`
and ending at vertex `ti`. If there exists no such walk, the answer is `-1`.

Return _the array_`answer` _, where_`answer[i]`_denotes the**minimum** cost of
a walk for query _`i`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5, edges = [[0,1,7],[1,3,7],[1,2,1]], query = [[0,3],[3,4]]

**Output:** [1,-1]

**Explanation:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/01/31/q4_example1-1.png)

To achieve the cost of 1 in the first query, we need to move on the following
edges: `0->1` (weight 7), `1->2` (weight 1), `2->1` (weight 1), `1->3` (weight
7).

In the second query, there is no walk between nodes 3 and 4, so the answer is
-1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,2,7],[0,1,15],[1,2,6],[1,2,1]], query = [[1,2]]

**Output:** [0]

**Explanation:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/01/31/q4_example2e.png)

To achieve the cost of 0 in the first query, we need to move on the following
edges: `1->2` (weight 1), `2->1` (weight 6), `1->2` (weight 1).

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= edges.length <= 10^5`
- `edges[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1`
- `ui != vi`
- `0 <= wi <= 10^5`
- `1 <= query.length <= 10^5`
- `query[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= si, ti <= n - 1`
- `si != ti`
