# [2478. Number of Beautiful Partitions](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-beautiful-partitions/)

## 题目

You are given a string `s` that consists of the digits `'1'` to `'9'` and two
integers `k` and `minLength`.

A partition of `s` is called **beautiful** if:

  * `s` is partitioned into `k` non-intersecting substrings.
  * Each substring has a length of **at least** `minLength`.
  * Each substring starts with a **prime** digit and ends with a **non-prime** digit. Prime digits are `'2'`, `'3'`, `'5'`, and `'7'`, and the rest of the digits are non-prime.

Return _the number of **beautiful** partitions of _`s`. Since the answer may
be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.



**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "23542185131", k = 3, minLength = 2
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation: There exists three ways to create a beautiful partition:
> 
> "2354 | 218 | 5131"
> 
> "2354 | 21851 | 31"
> 
> "2354218 | 51 | 31"

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "23542185131", k = 3, minLength = 3
> 
> Output: 1
> 
> Explanation: There exists one way to create a beautiful partition: "2354 | 218 | 5131".

**Example 3:**

> Input: s = "3312958", k = 3, minLength = 1
> 
> Output: 1
> 
> Explanation: There exists one way to create a beautiful partition: "331 | 29 | 58".

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= k, minLength <= s.length <= 1000`
  * `s` consists of the digits `'1'` to `'9'`.
