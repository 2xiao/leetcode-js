# [920. Number of Music Playlists](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-music-playlists/)

## 题目

Your music player contains `n` different songs. You want to listen to `goal`
songs (not necessarily different) during your trip. To avoid boredom, you will
create a playlist so that:

- Every song is played **at least once**.
- A song can only be played again only if `k` other songs have been played.

Given `n`, `goal`, and `k`, return _the number of possible playlists that you
can create_. Since the answer can be very large, return it **modulo** `109 +
7`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 3, goal = 3, k = 1
>
> Output: 6
>
> Explanation: There are 6 possible playlists: [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], and [3, 2, 1].

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 2, goal = 3, k = 0
>
> Output: 6
>
> Explanation: There are 6 possible playlists: [1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1], [2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2], and [1, 2, 2].

**Example 3:**

> Input: n = 2, goal = 3, k = 1
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: There are 2 possible playlists: [1, 2, 1] and [2, 1, 2].

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= k < n <= goal <= 100`
