# [2421. Number of Good Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-good-paths/)

## 题目

There is a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) consisting
of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and exactly `n - 1` edges.

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `vals` of length `n` where
`vals[i]` denotes the value of the `ith` node. You are also given a 2D integer
array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` denotes that there exists an
**undirected** edge connecting nodes `ai` and `bi`.

A **good path** is a simple path that satisfies the following conditions:

1. The starting node and the ending node have the **same** value.
2. All nodes between the starting node and the ending node have values **less than or equal to** the starting node (i.e. the starting node's value should be the maximum value along the path).

Return _the number of distinct good paths_.

Note that a path and its reverse are counted as the **same** path. For
example, `0 -> 1` is considered to be the same as `1 -> 0`. A single node is
also considered as a valid path.

**Example 1:**

> Input: vals = [1,3,2,1,3], edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[2,4]]
>
> Output: 6
>
> Explanation: There are 5 good paths consisting of a single node.
>
> There is 1 additional good path: 1 -> 0 -> 2 -> 4.
>
> (The reverse path 4 -> 2 -> 0 -> 1 is treated as the same as 1 -> 0 -> 2 -> 4.)
>
> Note that 0 -> 2 -> 3 is not a good path because vals[2] > vals[0].

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/08/04/149d3065ec165a71a1b9aec890776ff.png)

> Input: vals = [1,1,2,2,3], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[2,4]]
>
> Output: 7
>
> Explanation: There are 5 good paths consisting of a single node.
>
> There are 2 additional good paths: 0 -> 1 and 2 -> 3.

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/08/04/31705e22af3d9c0a557459bc7d1b62d.png)

> Input: vals = [1], edges = []
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation: The tree consists of only one node, so there is one good path.

**Constraints:**

- `n == vals.length`
- `1 <= n <= 3 * 10^4`
- `0 <= vals[i] <= 10^5`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi < n`
- `ai != bi`
- `edges` represents a valid tree.
