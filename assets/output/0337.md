# [337. House Robber III](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iii/)

## 题目

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only
one entrance to this area, called `root`.

Besides the `root`, each house has one and only one parent house. After a
tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary
tree. It will automatically contact the police if **two directly-linked houses
were broken into on the same night**.

Given the `root` of the binary tree, return _the maximum amount of money the
thief can rob **without alerting the police**_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
>
> Output: 7
>
> Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.

**Example 2:**

> Input: root = [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]
>
> Output: 9
>
> Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 10^4`
