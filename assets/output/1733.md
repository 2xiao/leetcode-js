# [1733. Minimum Number of People to Teach](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-people-to-teach)

## 题目

On a social network consisting of `m` users and some friendships between
users, two users can communicate with each other if they know a common
language.

You are given an integer `n`, an array `languages`, and an array `friendships`
where:

  * There are `n` languages numbered `1` through `n`,
  * `languages[i]` is the set of languages the `i​​​​​​th`​​​​ user knows, and
  * `friendships[i] = [u​​​​​​i​​​, v​​​​​​i]` denotes a friendship between the users `u​​​​​​​​​​​i`​​​​​ and `vi`.

You can choose **one** language and teach it to some users so that all friends
can communicate with each other. Return _the_ _**minimum** __number of users
you need to teach._

Note that friendships are not transitive, meaning if `x` is a friend of `y`
and `y` is a friend of `z`, this doesn't guarantee that `x` is a friend of
`z`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 2, languages = [[1],[2],[1,2]], friendships = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
    **Output:** 1
    **Explanation:** You can either teach user 1 the second language or user 2 the first language.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 3, languages = [[2],[1,3],[1,2],[3]], friendships = [[1,4],[1,2],[3,4],[2,3]]
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** Teach the third language to users 1 and 3, yielding two users to teach.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= n <= 500`
  * `languages.length == m`
  * `1 <= m <= 500`
  * `1 <= languages[i].length <= n`
  * `1 <= languages[i][j] <= n`
  * `1 <= u​​​​​​i < v​​​​​​i <= languages.length`
  * `1 <= friendships.length <= 500`
  * All tuples `(u​​​​​i, v​​​​​​i)` are unique
  * `languages[i]` contains only unique values
