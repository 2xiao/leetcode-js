# [2711. Difference of Number of Distinct Values on Diagonals](https://leetcode.com/problems/difference-of-number-of-distinct-values-on-diagonals)

## 题目

Given a **0-indexed** 2D `grid` of size `m x n`, you should find the matrix
`answer` of size `m x n`.

The value of each cell `(r, c)` of the matrix `answer` is calculated in the
following way:

  * Let `topLeft[r][c]` be the number of **distinct** values in the top-left diagonal of the cell `(r, c)` in the matrix `grid`.
  * Let `bottomRight[r][c]` be the number of **distinct** values in the bottom-right diagonal of the cell `(r, c)` in the matrix `grid`.

Then `answer[r][c] = |topLeft[r][c] - bottomRight[r][c]|`.

Return _the matrix_ `answer`.

A **matrix diagonal** is a diagonal line of cells starting from some cell in
either the topmost row or leftmost column and going in the bottom-right
direction until reaching the matrix's end.

A cell `(r1, c1)` belongs to the top-left diagonal of the cell `(r, c)`, if
both belong to the same diagonal and `r1 < r`. Similarly is defined bottom-
right diagonal.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/04/19/ex2.png)

    
    
    **Input:** grid = [[1,2,3],[3,1,5],[3,2,1]]
    **Output:** [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1]]
    **Explanation:** The 1st diagram denotes the initial grid. 
    The 2nd diagram denotes a grid for cell (0,0), where blue-colored cells are cells on its bottom-right diagonal.
    The 3rd diagram denotes a grid for cell (1,2), where red-colored cells are cells on its top-left diagonal.
    The 4th diagram denotes a grid for cell (1,1), where blue-colored cells are cells on its bottom-right diagonal and red-colored cells are cells on its top-left diagonal.
    - The cell (0,0) contains [1,1] on its bottom-right diagonal and [] on its top-left diagonal. The answer is |1 - 0| = 1.
    - The cell (1,2) contains [] on its bottom-right diagonal and [2] on its top-left diagonal. The answer is |0 - 1| = 1.
    - The cell (1,1) contains [1] on its bottom-right diagonal and [1] on its top-left diagonal. The answer is |1 - 1| = 0.
    The answers of other cells are similarly calculated.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** grid = [[1]]
    **Output:** [[0]]
    **Explanation:** - The cell (0,0) contains [] on its bottom-right diagonal and [] on its top-left diagonal. The answer is |0 - 0| = 0.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `m == grid.length`
  * `n == grid[i].length`
  * `1 <= m, n, grid[i][j] <= 50`
