# [2609. Find the Longest Balanced Substring of a Binary String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-longest-balanced-substring-of-a-binary-string/)

## 题目

You are given a binary string `s` consisting only of zeroes and ones.

A substring of `s` is considered balanced if **all zeroes are before ones**
and the number of zeroes is equal to the number of ones inside the substring.
Notice that the empty substring is considered a balanced substring.

Return _the length of the longest balanced substring of_`s`.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "01000111"
>
> Output: 6
>
> Explanation: The longest balanced substring is "000111", which has length 6.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "00111"
>
> Output: 4
>
> Explanation: The longest balanced substring is "0011", which has length 4.

**Example 3:**

> Input: s = "111"
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation: There is no balanced substring except the empty substring, so the answer is 0.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 50`
- `'0' <= s[i] <= '1'`
