# [1768. Merge Strings Alternately](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/)

## 题目

You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Merge the strings by adding
letters in alternating order, starting with `word1`. If a string is longer
than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged
string.

Return _the merged string._

**Example 1:**

>

> **Input:** word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"

> Output: "apbqcr"

> Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:

> word1: a b c

> word2:>
> p q r

> merged: a p b q c r

**Example 2:**

>

> **Input:** word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"

> Output: "apbqrs"

> Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.

> word1: a b

> word2:>
> p q r s

> merged: a p b q r s

**Example 3:**

>

> **Input:** word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"

> Output: "apbqcd"

## 解题思路

#### 复杂度分析

- **时间复杂度**：`O()`
- **空间复杂度**：`O()`nation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.

> word1: a b c d

> word2:>
> p q

> merged: a p b q c d

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100`
- `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.
