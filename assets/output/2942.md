# [2942. Find Words Containing Character](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-words-containing-character)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** array of strings `words` and a character `x`.

Return _an **array of indices** representing the words that contain the
character _`x`.

**Note** that the returned array may be in **any** order.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** words = ["leet","code"], x = "e"
    **Output:** [0,1]
    **Explanation:** "e" occurs in both words: "l ** _ee_** t", and "cod _ **e**_ ". Hence, we return indices 0 and 1.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "a"
    **Output:** [0,2]
    **Explanation:** "a" occurs in " ** _a_** bc", and " _ **aaaa**_ ". Hence, we return indices 0 and 2.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "z"
    **Output:** []
    **Explanation:** "z" does not occur in any of the words. Hence, we return an empty array.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= words.length <= 50`
  * `1 <= words[i].length <= 50`
  * `x` is a lowercase English letter.
  * `words[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters.
