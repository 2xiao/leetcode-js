# [2382. Maximum Segment Sum After Removals](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-segment-sum-after-removals)

## 题目

You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `nums` and `removeQueries`,
both of length `n`. For the `ith` query, the element in `nums` at the index
`removeQueries[i]` is removed, splitting `nums` into different segments.

A **segment** is a contiguous sequence of **positive** integers in `nums`. A
**segment sum** is the sum of every element in a segment.

Return _an integer array_`answer` _, of length_`n` _, where_`answer[i]` _is
the **maximum** segment sum after applying the _`ith` _removal._

**Note:** The same index will **not** be removed more than once.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [1,2,5,6,1], removeQueries = [0,3,2,4,1]
    **Output:** [14,7,2,2,0]
    **Explanation:** Using 0 to indicate a removed element, the answer is as follows:
    Query 1: Remove the 0th element, nums becomes [0,2,5,6,1] and the maximum segment sum is 14 for segment [2,5,6,1].
    Query 2: Remove the 3rd element, nums becomes [0,2,5,0,1] and the maximum segment sum is 7 for segment [2,5].
    Query 3: Remove the 2nd element, nums becomes [0,2,0,0,1] and the maximum segment sum is 2 for segment [2]. 
    Query 4: Remove the 4th element, nums becomes [0,2,0,0,0] and the maximum segment sum is 2 for segment [2]. 
    Query 5: Remove the 1st element, nums becomes [0,0,0,0,0] and the maximum segment sum is 0, since there are no segments.
    Finally, we return [14,7,2,2,0].

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [3,2,11,1], removeQueries = [3,2,1,0]
    **Output:** [16,5,3,0]
    **Explanation:** Using 0 to indicate a removed element, the answer is as follows:
    Query 1: Remove the 3rd element, nums becomes [3,2,11,0] and the maximum segment sum is 16 for segment [3,2,11].
    Query 2: Remove the 2nd element, nums becomes [3,2,0,0] and the maximum segment sum is 5 for segment [3,2].
    Query 3: Remove the 1st element, nums becomes [3,0,0,0] and the maximum segment sum is 3 for segment [3].
    Query 4: Remove the 0th element, nums becomes [0,0,0,0] and the maximum segment sum is 0, since there are no segments.
    Finally, we return [16,5,3,0].
    



**Constraints:**

  * `n == nums.length == removeQueries.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 105`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`
  * `0 <= removeQueries[i] < n`
  * All the values of `removeQueries` are **unique**.
