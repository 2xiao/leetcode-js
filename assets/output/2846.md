# [2846. Minimum Edge Weight Equilibrium Queries in a Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-edge-weight-equilibrium-queries-in-a-tree)

## 题目

There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You
are given the integer `n` and a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`,
where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes
`ui` and `vi` with weight `wi` in the tree.

You are also given a 2D integer array `queries` of length `m`, where
`queries[i] = [ai, bi]`. For each query, find the **minimum number of
operations** required to make the weight of every edge on the path from `ai`
to `bi` equal. In one operation, you can choose any edge of the tree and
change its weight to any value.

**Note** that:

  * Queries are **independent** of each other, meaning that the tree returns to its **initial state** on each new query.
  * The path from `ai` to `bi` is a sequence of **distinct** nodes starting with node `ai` and ending with node `bi` such that every two adjacent nodes in the sequence share an edge in the tree.

Return _an array_`answer` _of length_`m` _where_ `answer[i]` _is the answer to
the_ `ith` _query._



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/08/11/graph-6-1.png)

> Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,2],[4,5,2],[5,6,2]], queries = [[0,3],[3,6],[2,6],[0,6]]
> 
> Output: [0,0,1,3]
> 
> Explanation: In the first query, all the edges in the path from 0 to 3 have a weight of 1. Hence, the answer is 0.
> 
> In the second query, all the edges in the path from 3 to 6 have a weight of 2. Hence, the answer is 0.
> 
> In the third query, we change the weight of edge [2,3] to 2. After this operation, all the edges in the path from 2 to 6 have a weight of 2. Hence, the answer is 1.
> 
> In the fourth query, we change the weights of edges [0,1], [1,2] and [2,3] to 2. After these operations, all the edges in the path from 0 to 6 have a weight of 2. Hence, the answer is 3.
> 
> For each queries[i], it can be shown that answer[i] is the minimum number of operations needed to equalize all the edge weights in the path from ai to bi.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/08/11/graph-9-1.png)

> Input: n = 8, edges = [[1,2,6],[1,3,4],[2,4,6],[2,5,3],[3,6,6],[3,0,8],[7,0,2]], queries = [[4,6],[0,4],[6,5],[7,4]]
> 
> Output: [1,2,2,3]
> 
> Explanation: In the first query, we change the weight of edge [1,3] to 6. After this operation, all the edges in the path from 4 to 6 have a weight of 6. Hence, the answer is 1.
> 
> In the second query, we change the weight of edges [0,3] and [3,1] to 6. After these operations, all the edges in the path from 0 to 4 have a weight of 6. Hence, the answer is 2.
> 
> In the third query, we change the weight of edges [1,3] and [5,2] to 6. After these operations, all the edges in the path from 6 to 5 have a weight of 6. Hence, the answer is 2.
> 
> In the fourth query, we change the weights of edges [0,7], [0,3] and [1,3] to 6. After these operations, all the edges in the path from 7 to 4 have a weight of 6. Hence, the answer is 3.
> 
> For each queries[i], it can be shown that answer[i] is the minimum number of operations needed to equalize all the edge weights in the path from ai to bi.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 104`
  * `edges.length == n - 1`
  * `edges[i].length == 3`
  * `0 <= ui, vi < n`
  * `1 <= wi <= 26`
  * The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.
  * `1 <= queries.length == m <= 2 * 104`
  * `queries[i].length == 2`
  * `0 <= ai, bi < n`
