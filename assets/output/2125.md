# [2125. Number of Laser Beams in a Bank](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-laser-beams-in-a-bank)

## 题目

Anti-theft security devices are activated inside a bank. You are given a
**0-indexed** binary string array `bank` representing the floor plan of the
bank, which is an `m x n` 2D matrix. `bank[i]` represents the `ith` row,
consisting of `'0'`s and `'1'`s. `'0'` means the cell is empty, while`'1'`
means the cell has a security device.

There is **one** laser beam between any **two** security devices **if both**
conditions are met:

  * The two devices are located on two **different rows** : `r1` and `r2`, where `r1 < r2`.
  * For **each** row `i` where `r1 < i < r2`, there are **no security devices** in the `ith` row.

Laser beams are independent, i.e., one beam does not interfere nor join with
another.

Return _the total number of laser beams in the bank_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: bank = ["011001","000000","010100","001000"]
> 
> Output: 8
> 
> Explanation: Between each of the following device pairs, there is one beam. In total, there are 8 beams:
> 
>  * bank[0][1] -- bank[2][1]
> 
>  * bank[0][1] -- bank[2][3]
> 
>  * bank[0][2] -- bank[2][1]
> 
>  * bank[0][2] -- bank[2][3]
> 
>  * bank[0][5] -- bank[2][1]
> 
>  * bank[0][5] -- bank[2][3]
> 
>  * bank[2][1] -- bank[3][2]
> 
>  * bank[2][3] -- bank[3][2]
> 
> Note that there is no beam between any device on the 0th row with any on the 3rd row.
> 
> This is because the 2nd row contains security devices, which breaks the second condition.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/24/laser2.jpg)

> Input: bank = ["000","111","000"]
> 
> Output: 0
> 
> Explanation: There does not exist two devices located on two different rows.

**Constraints:**

  * `m == bank.length`
  * `n == bank[i].length`
  * `1 <= m, n <= 500`
  * `bank[i][j]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
