# [2412. Minimum Money Required Before Transactions](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-money-required-before-transactions)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `transactions`, where
`transactions[i] = [costi, cashbacki]`.

The array describes transactions, where each transaction must be completed
exactly once in **some order**. At any given moment, you have a certain amount
of `money`. In order to complete transaction `i`, `money >= costi` must hold
true. After performing a transaction, `money` becomes `money - costi +
cashbacki`.

Return _the minimum amount of_`money` _required before any transaction so that
all of the transactions can be completed **regardless of the order** of the
transactions._



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** transactions = [[2,1],[5,0],[4,2]]
    **Output:** 10
    **Explanation:** Starting with money = 10, the transactions can be performed in any order.
    It can be shown that starting with money < 10 will fail to complete all transactions in some order.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** transactions = [[3,0],[0,3]]
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:**
    - If transactions are in the order [[3,0],[0,3]], the minimum money required to complete the transactions is 3.
    - If transactions are in the order [[0,3],[3,0]], the minimum money required to complete the transactions is 0.
    Thus, starting with money = 3, the transactions can be performed in any order.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= transactions.length <= 105`
  * `transactions[i].length == 2`
  * `0 <= costi, cashbacki <= 109`
