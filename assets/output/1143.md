# [1143. Longest Common Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)

## 题目

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return _the length of their longest
**common subsequence**. _If there is no **common subsequence** , return `0`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original
string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the
relative order of the remaining characters.

  * For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to
both strings.



**Example 1:**

> Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
> 
> Output: 3  
> 
> Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

**Example 2:**

> Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

**Example 3:**

> Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
> 
> Output: 0
> 
> Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000`
  * `text1` and `text2` consist of only lowercase English characters.
