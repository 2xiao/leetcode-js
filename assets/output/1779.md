# [1779. Find Nearest Point That Has the Same X or Y Coordinate](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-nearest-point-that-has-the-same-x-or-y-coordinate)

## 题目

You are given two integers, `x` and `y`, which represent your current location
on a Cartesian grid: `(x, y)`. You are also given an array `points` where each
`points[i] = [ai, bi]` represents that a point exists at `(ai, bi)`. A point
is **valid** if it shares the same x-coordinate or the same y-coordinate as
your location.

Return _the index **(0-indexed)** of the **valid** point with the smallest
**Manhattan distance** from your current location_. If there are multiple,
return _the valid point with the **smallest** index_. If there are no valid
points, return `-1`.

The **Manhattan distance** between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is
`abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2)`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** x = 3, y = 4, points = [[1,2],[3,1],[2,4],[2,3],[4,4]]
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** Of all the points, only [3,1], [2,4] and [4,4] are valid. Of the valid points, [2,4] and [4,4] have the smallest Manhattan distance from your current location, with a distance of 1. [2,4] has the smallest index, so return 2.

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** x = 3, y = 4, points = [[3,4]]
    **Output:** 0
    **Explanation:** The answer is allowed to be on the same location as your current location.

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** x = 3, y = 4, points = [[2,3]]
    **Output:** -1
    **Explanation:** There are no valid points.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= points.length <= 104`
  * `points[i].length == 2`
  * `1 <= x, y, ai, bi <= 104`
