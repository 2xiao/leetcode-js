# [2446. Determine if Two Events Have Conflict](https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-two-events-have-conflict)

## 题目

You are given two arrays of strings that represent two inclusive events that
happened **on the same day** , `event1` and `event2`, where:

  * `event1 = [startTime1, endTime1]` and
  * `event2 = [startTime2, endTime2]`.

Event times are valid 24 hours format in the form of `HH:MM`.

A **conflict** happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e.,
some moment is common to both events).

Return `true` _if there is a conflict between two events. Otherwise,
return_`false`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** event1 = ["01:15","02:00"], event2 = ["02:00","03:00"]
    **Output:** true
    **Explanation:** The two events intersect at time 2:00.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** event1 = ["01:00","02:00"], event2 = ["01:20","03:00"]
    **Output:** true
    **Explanation:** The two events intersect starting from 01:20 to 02:00.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** event1 = ["10:00","11:00"], event2 = ["14:00","15:00"]
    **Output:** false
    **Explanation:** The two events do not intersect.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `evnet1.length == event2.length == 2.`
  * `event1[i].length == event2[i].length == 5`
  * `startTime1 <= endTime1`
  * `startTime2 <= endTime2`
  * All the event times follow the `HH:MM` format.
