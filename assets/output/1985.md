# [1985. Find the Kth Largest Integer in the Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-kth-largest-integer-in-the-array)

## 题目

You are given an array of strings `nums` and an integer `k`. Each string in
`nums` represents an integer without leading zeros.

Return _the string that represents the_`kth` _ **largest integer** in _`nums`.

**Note** : Duplicate numbers should be counted distinctly. For example, if
`nums` is `["1","2","2"]`, `"2"` is the first largest integer, `"2"` is the
second-largest integer, and `"1"` is the third-largest integer.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = ["3","6","7","10"], k = 4
    **Output:** "3"
    **Explanation:**
    The numbers in nums sorted in non-decreasing order are ["3","6","7","10"].
    The 4th largest integer in nums is "3".
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = ["2","21","12","1"], k = 3
    **Output:** "2"
    **Explanation:**
    The numbers in nums sorted in non-decreasing order are ["1","2","12","21"].
    The 3rd largest integer in nums is "2".
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = ["0","0"], k = 2
    **Output:** "0"
    **Explanation:**
    The numbers in nums sorted in non-decreasing order are ["0","0"].
    The 2nd largest integer in nums is "0".
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 104`
  * `1 <= nums[i].length <= 100`
  * `nums[i]` consists of only digits.
  * `nums[i]` will not have any leading zeros.
