# [1019. Next Greater Node In Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-node-in-linked-list/)

## 题目

You are given the `head` of a linked list with `n` nodes.

For each node in the list, find the value of the **next greater node**. That
is, for each node, find the value of the first node that is next to it and has
a **strictly larger** value than it.

Return an integer array `answer` where `answer[i]` is the value of the next
greater node of the `ith` node ( **1-indexed** ). If the `ith` node does not
have a next greater node, set `answer[i] = 0`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: head = [2,1,5]
>
> Output: [5,5,0]

**Example 2:**

> Input: head = [2,7,4,3,5]
>
> Output: [7,0,5,5,0]

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
- `1 <= n <= 10^4`
- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
