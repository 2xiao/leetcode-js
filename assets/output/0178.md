Write a solution to find the rank of the scores. The ranking should be
calculated according to the following rules:

  * The scores should be ranked from the highest to the lowest.
  * If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking.
  * After a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no holes between ranks.

Return the result table ordered by `score` in descending order.

The result format is in the following example.



**Example 1:**

> Input: 
> 
> Scores table:
> 
> +----+-------+
> 
> | id | score |
> 
> +----+-------+
> 
> | 1  | 3.50  |
> 
> | 2  | 3.65  |
> 
> | 3  | 4.00  |
> 
> | 4  | 3.85  |
> 
> | 5  | 4.00  |
> 
> | 6  | 3.65  |
> 
> +----+-------+
> 
> Output: 
> 
> +-------+------+
> 
> | score | rank |
> 
> +-------+------+
> 
> | 4.00  | 1>

> 
> | 4.00  | 1>

> | 3.85  | 2>
