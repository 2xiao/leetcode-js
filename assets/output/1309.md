# [1309. Decrypt String from Alphabet to Integer Mapping](https://leetcode.com/problems/decrypt-string-from-alphabet-to-integer-mapping)

## 题目

You are given a string `s` formed by digits and `'#'`. We want to map `s` to
English lowercase characters as follows:

  * Characters (`'a'` to `'i'`) are represented by (`'1'` to `'9'`) respectively.
  * Characters (`'j'` to `'z'`) are represented by (`'10#'` to `'26#'`) respectively.

Return _the string formed after mapping_.

The test cases are generated so that a unique mapping will always exist.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "10#11#12"
    **Output:** "jkab"
    **Explanation:** "j" -> "10#" , "k" -> "11#" , "a" -> "1" , "b" -> "2".
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "1326#"
    **Output:** "acz"
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
  * `s` consists of digits and the `'#'` letter.
  * `s` will be a valid string such that mapping is always possible.
