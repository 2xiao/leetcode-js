# [2029. Stone Game IX](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-ix/)

## 题目

Alice and Bob continue their games with stones. There is a row of n stones,
and each stone has an associated value. You are given an integer array
`stones`, where `stones[i]` is the **value** of the `ith` stone.

Alice and Bob take turns, with **Alice** starting first. On each turn, the
player may remove any stone from `stones`. The player who removes a stone
**loses** if the **sum** of the values of **all removed stones** is divisible
by `3`. Bob will win automatically if there are no remaining stones (even if
it is Alice's turn).

Assuming both players play **optimally** , return `true` _if Alice wins and_
`false` _if Bob wins_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: stones = [2,1]
> 
> Output: true
> 
> Explanation:  The game will be played as follows:
> - Turn 1: Alice can remove either stone.
> - Turn 2: Bob removes the remaining stone. 
> 
> The sum of the removed stones is 1 + 2 = 3 and is divisible by 3. Therefore, Bob loses and Alice wins the game.

**Example 2:**

> Input: stones = [2]
> 
> Output: false
> 
> Explanation:  Alice will remove the only stone, and the sum of the values on the removed stones is 2. 
> 
> Since all the stones are removed and the sum of values is not divisible by 3, Bob wins the game.

**Example 3:**

> Input: stones = [5,1,2,4,3]
> 
> Output: false
> 
> Explanation: Bob will always win. One possible way for Bob to win is shown below:
> - Turn 1: Alice can remove the second stone with value 1. Sum of removed stones = 1.
> - Turn 2: Bob removes the fifth stone with value 3. Sum of removed stones = 1 + 3 = 4.
> - Turn 3: Alices removes the fourth stone with value 4. Sum of removed stones = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8.
> - Turn 4: Bob removes the third stone with value 2. Sum of removed stones = 1 + 3 + 4 + 2 = 10.
> - Turn 5: Alice removes the first stone with value 5. Sum of removed stones = 1 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 5 = 15.
> 
> Alice loses the game because the sum of the removed stones (15) is divisible by 3. Bob wins the game.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= stones.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= stones[i] <= 104`
