# [1307. Verbal Arithmetic Puzzle](https://leetcode.com/problems/verbal-arithmetic-puzzle/)

## 题目

Given an equation, represented by `words` on the left side and the `result` on
the right side.

You need to check if the equation is solvable under the following rules:

- Each character is decoded as one digit (0 - 9).
- No two characters can map to the same digit.
- Each `words[i]` and `result` are decoded as one number **without** leading zeros.
- Sum of numbers on the left side (`words`) will equal to the number on the right side (`result`).

Return `true` _if the equation is solvable, otherwise return_ `false`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: words = ["SEND","MORE"], result = "MONEY"
>
> Output: true
>
> Explanation: Map 'S'-> 9, 'E'->5, 'N'->6, 'D'->7, 'M'->1, 'O'->0, 'R'->8, 'Y'->'2'
>
> Such that: "SEND" + "MORE" = "MONEY" , 9567 + 1085 = 10652

**Example 2:**

> Input: words = ["SIX","SEVEN","SEVEN"], result = "TWENTY"
>
> Output: true
>
> Explanation: Map 'S'-> 6, 'I'->5, 'X'->0, 'E'->8, 'V'->7, 'N'->2, 'T'->1, 'W'->'3', 'Y'->4
>
> Such that: "SIX" + "SEVEN" + "SEVEN" = "TWENTY" , 650 + 68782 + 68782 = 138214

**Example 3:**

> Input: words = ["LEET","CODE"], result = "POINT"
>
> Output: false
>
> Explanation: There is no possible mapping to satisfy the equation, so we return false.
>
> Note that two different characters cannot map to the same digit.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= words.length <= 5`
- `1 <= words[i].length, result.length <= 7`
- `words[i], result` contain only uppercase English letters.
- The number of different characters used in the expression is at most `10`.
