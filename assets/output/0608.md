Each node in the tree can be one of three types:

  * **" Leaf"**: if the node is a leaf node.
  * **" Root"**: if the node is the root of the tree.
  * **" Inner"**: If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.

Write a solution to report the type of each node in the tree.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.



**Example 1:**

> Input: 
> 
> Tree table:
> 
> +----+------+
> 
> | id | p_id |
> 
> +----+------+
> 
> | 1  | null |
> 
> | 2  | 1> 
> |
> 
> | 3  | 1> 
> |
> 
> | 4  | 2> 
> |
> 
> | 5  | 2> 
> |
> 
> +----+------+
> 
> Output: 
> 
> +----+-------+
> 
> | id | type  |
> 
> +----+-------+
> 
> | 1  | Root  |
> 
> | 2  | Inner |
> 
> | 3  | Leaf  |
> 
> | 4  | Leaf  |
> 
> | 5  | Leaf  |
> 
> +----+-------+
> 
> Explanation: 
> 
> Node 1 is the root node because its parent node is null and it has child nodes 2 and 3.
> 
> Node 2 is an inner node because it has parent node 1 and child node 4 and 5.
> 
> Nodes 3, 4, and 5 are leaf nodes because they have parent nodes and they do not have child nodes.

> Input:

> Tree table:

> +----+------+
> 
> | id | p_id |
> 
> +----+------+
> 
> | 1  | null |

> +----+-------+
> 
> | id | type  |
> 
> +----+-------+
> 
> | 1  | Root  |
> 
> +----+-------+
> 
> Explanation: If there is only one node on the tree, you only need to output its root attributes.
