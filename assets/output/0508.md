# [508. Most Frequent Subtree Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-frequent-subtree-sum)

## 题目

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the most frequent **subtree sum**.
If there is a tie, return all the values with the highest frequency in any
order.

The **subtree sum** of a node is defined as the sum of all the node values
formed by the subtree rooted at that node (including the node itself).



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** root = [5,2,-3]
    **Output:** [2,-3,4]
    

**Example 2:**

    **Input:** root = [5,2,-5]
    **Output:** [2]
    



**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
  * `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
