# [2250. Count Number of Rectangles Containing Each Point](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-rectangles-containing-each-point/)

## 题目

You are given a 2D integer array `rectangles` where `rectangles[i] = [li, hi]`
indicates that `ith` rectangle has a length of `li` and a height of `hi`. You
are also given a 2D integer array `points` where `points[j] = [xj, yj]` is a
point with coordinates `(xj, yj)`.

The `ith` rectangle has its **bottom-left corner** point at the coordinates
`(0, 0)` and its **top-right corner** point at `(li, hi)`.

Return _an integer array_`count` _of length_`points.length` _where_`count[j]`
_is the number of rectangles that **contain** the _`jth` _point._

The `ith` rectangle **contains** the `jth` point if `0 <= xj <= li` and `0 <=
yj <= hi`. Note that points that lie on the **edges** of a rectangle are also
considered to be contained by that rectangle.

**Example 1:**

> Input: rectangles = [[1,2],[2,3],[2,5]], points = [[2,1],[1,4]]
>
> Output: [2,1]
>
> Explanation:
>
> The first rectangle contains no points.
>
> The second rectangle contains only the point (2, 1).
>
> The third rectangle contains the points (2, 1) and (1, 4).
>
> The number of rectangles that contain the point (2, 1) is 2.
>
> The number of rectangles that contain the point (1, 4) is 1.
>
> Therefore, we return [2, 1].

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/02/example2.png)

> Input: rectangles = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]], points = [[1,3],[1,1]]
>
> Output: [1,3]
>
> Explanation: The first rectangle contains only the point (1, 1).
>
> The second rectangle contains only the point (1, 1).
>
> The third rectangle contains the points (1, 3) and (1, 1).
>
> The number of rectangles that contain the point (1, 3) is 1.
>
> The number of rectangles that contain the point (1, 1) is 3.
>
> Therefore, we return [1, 3].

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= rectangles.length, points.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `rectangles[i].length == points[j].length == 2`
- `1 <= li, xj <= 10^9`
- `1 <= hi, yj <= 100`
- All the `rectangles` are **unique**.
- All the `points` are **unique**.
