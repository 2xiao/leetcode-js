# [2435. Paths in Matrix Whose Sum Is Divisible by K](https://leetcode.com/problems/paths-in-matrix-whose-sum-is-divisible-by-k)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** `m x n` integer matrix `grid` and an integer
`k`. You are currently at position `(0, 0)` and you want to reach position `(m
- 1, n - 1)` moving only **down** or **right**.

Return _the number of paths where the sum of the elements on the path is
divisible by_`k`. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo**
`109 + 7`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: grid = [[5,2,4],[3,0,5],[0,7,2]], k = 3
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: There are two paths where the sum of the elements on the path is divisible by k.
> 
> The first path highlighted in red has a sum of 5 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 2 = 18 which is divisible by 3.
> 
> The second path highlighted in blue has a sum of 5 + 3 + 0 + 5 + 2 = 15 which is divisible by 3.

**Example 2:**

> Input: grid = [[0,0]], k = 5
> 
> Output: 1
> 
> Explanation: The path highlighted in red has a sum of 0 + 0 = 0 which is divisible by 5.

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/08/12/image-20220812224605-3.png)

> Input: grid = [[7,3,4,9],[2,3,6,2],[2,3,7,0]], k = 1
> 
> Output: 10
> 
> Explanation: Every integer is divisible by 1 so the sum of the elements on every possible path is divisible by k.

**Constraints:**

  * `m == grid.length`
  * `n == grid[i].length`
  * `1 <= m, n <= 5 * 104`
  * `1 <= m * n <= 5 * 104`
  * `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`
  * `1 <= k <= 50`
