# [1790. Check if One String Swap Can Make Strings Equal](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-one-string-swap-can-make-strings-equal)

## 题目

You are given two strings `s1` and `s2` of equal length. A **string swap** is
an operation where you choose two indices in a string (not necessarily
different) and swap the characters at these indices.

Return `true` _if it is possible to make both strings equal by performing **at
most one string swap** on **exactly one** of the strings. _Otherwise, return
`false`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** s1 = "bank", s2 = "kanb"
    **Output:** true
    **Explanation:** For example, swap the first character with the last character of s2 to make "bank".
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** s1 = "attack", s2 = "defend"
    **Output:** false
    **Explanation:** It is impossible to make them equal with one string swap.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** s1 = "kelb", s2 = "kelb"
    **Output:** true
    **Explanation:** The two strings are already equal, so no string swap operation is required.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100`
  * `s1.length == s2.length`
  * `s1` and `s2` consist of only lowercase English letters.
