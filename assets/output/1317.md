# [1317. Convert Integer to the Sum of Two No-Zero Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-integer-to-the-sum-of-two-no-zero-integers)

## 题目

**No-Zero integer** is a positive integer that **does not contain any`0`** in
its decimal representation.

Given an integer `n`, return _a list of two integers_ `[a, b]` _where_ :

  * `a` and `b` are **No-Zero integers**.
  * `a + b = n`

The test cases are generated so that there is at least one valid solution. If
there are many valid solutions, you can return any of them.



**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 2
> 
> Output: [1,1]
> 
> Explanation: Let a = 1 and b = 1.
> 
> Both a and b are no-zero integers, and a + b = 2 = n.

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 11
> 
> Output: [2,9]
> 
> Explanation: Let a = 2 and b = 9.
> 
> Both a and b are no-zero integers, and a + b = 9 = n.
> 
> Note that there are other valid answers as [8, 3] that can be accepted.

**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= n <= 104`
