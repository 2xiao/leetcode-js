# [891. Sum of Subsequence Widths](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-subsequence-widths)

## 题目

The **width** of a sequence is the difference between the maximum and minimum
elements in the sequence.

Given an array of integers `nums`, return _the sum of the **widths** of all
the non-empty **subsequences** of _`nums`. Since the answer may be very large,
return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting
some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For
example, `[3,6,2,7]` is a subsequence of the array `[0,3,1,6,2,2,7]`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [2,1,3]
> 
> Output: 6
> 
> Explanation: The subsequences are [1], [2], [3], [2,1], [2,3], [1,3], [2,1,3].
> 
> The corresponding widths are 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2.
> 
> The sum of these widths is 6.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [2]
> 
> Output: 0

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 105`
