# [230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst)

## 题目

Given the `root` of a binary search tree, and an integer `k`, return _the_
`kth` _smallest value ( **1-indexed** ) of all the values of the nodes in the
tree_.



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
    **Output:** 1
    

**Example 2:**

    **Input:** root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
    **Output:** 3
    



**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.
  * `1 <= k <= n <= 104`
  * `0 <= Node.val <= 104`



**Follow up:** If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete
operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you
optimize?
