# [1319. Number of Operations to Make Network Connected](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-operations-to-make-network-connected)

## 题目

There are `n` computers numbered from `0` to `n - 1` connected by ethernet
cables `connections` forming a network where `connections[i] = [ai, bi]`
represents a connection between computers `ai` and `bi`. Any computer can
reach any other computer directly or indirectly through the network.

You are given an initial computer network `connections`. You can extract
certain cables between two directly connected computers, and place them
between any pair of disconnected computers to make them directly connected.

Return _the minimum number of times you need to do this in order to make all
the computers connected_. If it is not possible, return `-1`.



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2]]
    **Output:** 1
    **Explanation:** Remove cable between computer 1 and 2 and place between computers 1 and 3.
    

**Example 2:**

    **Input:** n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]
    **Output:** 2
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2]]
    **Output:** -1
    **Explanation:** There are not enough cables.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 105`
  * `1 <= connections.length <= min(n * (n - 1) / 2, 105)`
  * `connections[i].length == 2`
  * `0 <= ai, bi < n`
  * `ai != bi`
  * There are no repeated connections.
  * No two computers are connected by more than one cable.
