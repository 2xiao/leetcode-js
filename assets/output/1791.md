# [1791. Find Center of Star Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-center-of-star-graph)

## 题目

There is an undirected **star** graph consisting of `n` nodes labeled from `1`
to `n`. A star graph is a graph where there is one **center** node and
**exactly** `n - 1` edges that connect the center node with every other node.

You are given a 2D integer array `edges` where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi]`
indicates that there is an edge between the nodes `ui` and `vi`. Return the
center of the given star graph.



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,2]]
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** As shown in the figure above, node 2 is connected to every other node, so 2 is the center.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** edges = [[1,2],[5,1],[1,3],[1,4]]
    **Output:** 1
    



**Constraints:**

  * `3 <= n <= 105`
  * `edges.length == n - 1`
  * `edges[i].length == 2`
  * `1 <= ui, vi <= n`
  * `ui != vi`
  * The given `edges` represent a valid star graph.
