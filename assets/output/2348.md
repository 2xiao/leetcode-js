# [2348. Number of Zero-Filled Subarrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-zero-filled-subarrays)

## 题目

Given an integer array `nums`, return _the number of **subarrays** filled with
_`0`.

A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [1,3,0,0,2,0,0,4]
    **Output:** 6
    **Explanation:** 
    There are 4 occurrences of [0] as a subarray.
    There are 2 occurrences of [0,0] as a subarray.
    There is no occurrence of a subarray with a size more than 2 filled with 0. Therefore, we return 6.

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [0,0,0,2,0,0]
    **Output:** 9
    **Explanation:** There are 5 occurrences of [0] as a subarray.
    There are 3 occurrences of [0,0] as a subarray.
    There is 1 occurrence of [0,0,0] as a subarray.
    There is no occurrence of a subarray with a size more than 3 filled with 0. Therefore, we return 9.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [2,10,2019]
    **Output:** 0
    **Explanation:** There is no subarray filled with 0. Therefore, we return 0.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
