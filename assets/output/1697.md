# [1697. Checking Existence of Edge Length Limited Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/checking-existence-of-edge-length-limited-paths)

## 题目

An undirected graph of `n` nodes is defined by `edgeList`, where `edgeList[i]
= [ui, vi, disi]` denotes an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi` with distance
`disi`. Note that there may be **multiple** edges between two nodes.

Given an array `queries`, where `queries[j] = [pj, qj, limitj]`, your task is
to determine for each `queries[j]` whether there is a path between `pj` and
`qj` such that each edge on the path has a distance **strictly less than**
`limitj` .

Return _a **boolean array** _`answer` _, where_`answer.length ==
queries.length` _and the_`jth` _value of_`answer` _is_`true` _if there is a
path for_`queries[j]` _is_`true` _, and_`false` _otherwise_.



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** n = 3, edgeList = [[0,1,2],[1,2,4],[2,0,8],[1,0,16]], queries = [[0,1,2],[0,2,5]]
    **Output:** [false,true]
    **Explanation:** The above figure shows the given graph. Note that there are two overlapping edges between 0 and 1 with distances 2 and 16.
    For the first query, between 0 and 1 there is no path where each distance is less than 2, thus we return false for this query.
    For the second query, there is a path (0 -> 1 -> 2) of two edges with distances less than 5, thus we return true for this query.
    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/08/q.png)

    
    
    **Input:** n = 5, edgeList = [[0,1,10],[1,2,5],[2,3,9],[3,4,13]], queries = [[0,4,14],[1,4,13]]
    **Output:** [true,false]
    **Explanation:** The above figure shows the given graph.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= n <= 105`
  * `1 <= edgeList.length, queries.length <= 105`
  * `edgeList[i].length == 3`
  * `queries[j].length == 3`
  * `0 <= ui, vi, pj, qj <= n - 1`
  * `ui != vi`
  * `pj != qj`
  * `1 <= disi, limitj <= 109`
  * There may be **multiple** edges between two nodes.
