# [887. Super Egg Drop](https://leetcode.com/problems/super-egg-drop/)

## 题目

You are given `k` identical eggs and you have access to a building with `n`
floors labeled from `1` to `n`.

You know that there exists a floor `f` where `0 <= f <= n` such that any egg
dropped at a floor **higher** than `f` will **break** , and any egg dropped
**at or below** floor `f` will **not break**.

Each move, you may take an unbroken egg and drop it from any floor `x` (where
`1 <= x <= n`). If the egg breaks, you can no longer use it. However, if the
egg does not break, you may **reuse** it in future moves.

Return _the **minimum number of moves** that you need to determine **with
certainty** what the value of _`f` is.



**Example 1:**

> Input: k = 1, n = 2
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> Drop the egg from floor 1. If it breaks, we know that f = 0.
> 
> Otherwise, drop the egg from floor 2. If it breaks, we know that f = 1.
> 
> If it does not break, then we know f = 2.
> 
> Hence, we need at minimum 2 moves to determine with certainty what the value of f is.

**Example 2:**

> Input: k = 2, n = 6
> 
> Output: 3

**Example 3:**

> Input: k = 3, n = 14
> 
> Output: 4

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= k <= 100`
  * `1 <= n <= 104`
