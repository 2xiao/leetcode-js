# [1510. Stone Game IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-iv)

## 题目

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there are `n` stones in a pile. On each player's turn, that player
makes a _move_ consisting of removing **any** non-zero **square number** of
stones in the pile.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.

Given a positive integer `n`, return `true` if and only if Alice wins the game
otherwise return `false`, assuming both players play optimally.



**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 1
> 
> Output: true
> 
> Explanation: Alice can remove 1 stone winning the game because Bob doesn't have any moves.

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 2
> 
> Output: false
> 
> Explanation: Alice can only remove 1 stone, after that Bob removes the last one winning the game (2 -> 1 -> 0).

**Example 3:**

> Input: n = 4
> 
> Output: true
> 
> Explanation: n is already a perfect square, Alice can win with one move, removing 4 stones (4 -> 0).

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 105`
