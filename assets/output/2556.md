# [2556. Disconnect Path in a Binary Matrix by at Most One Flip](https://leetcode.com/problems/disconnect-path-in-a-binary-matrix-by-at-most-one-flip/)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** `m x n` **binary** matrix `grid`. You can move
from a cell `(row, col)` to any of the cells `(row + 1, col)` or `(row, col +
1)` that has the value `1`. The matrix is **disconnected** if there is no path
from `(0, 0)` to `(m - 1, n - 1)`.

You can flip the value of **at most one** (possibly none) cell. You **cannot
flip** the cells `(0, 0)` and `(m - 1, n - 1)`.

Return `true` _if it is possible to make the matrix disconnect or_`false`
_otherwise_.

**Note** that flipping a cell changes its value from `0` to `1` or from `1` to
`0`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,0,0],[1,1,1]]
>
> Output: true
>
> Explanation: We can change the cell shown in the diagram above. There is no path from (0, 0) to (2, 2) in the resulting grid.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/12/07/yetgrid3drawio.png)

> Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
>
> Output: false
>
> Explanation: It is not possible to change at most one cell such that there is not path from (0, 0) to (2, 2).

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 1000`
- `1 <= m * n <= 10^5`
- `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
- `grid[0][0] == grid[m - 1][n - 1] == 1`
