# [1854. Maximum Population Year](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-population-year/)

## 题目

You are given a 2D integer array `logs` where each `logs[i] = [birthi,
deathi]` indicates the birth and death years of the `ith` person.

The **population** of some year `x` is the number of people alive during that
year. The `ith` person is counted in year `x`'s population if `x` is in the
**inclusive** range `[birthi, deathi - 1]`. Note that the person is **not**
counted in the year that they die.

Return _the **earliest** year with the **maximum population**_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: logs = [[1993,1999],[2000,2010]]
> 
> Output: 1993
> 
> Explanation: The maximum population is 1, and 1993 is the earliest year with this population.

**Example 2:**

> Input: logs = [[1950,1961],[1960,1971],[1970,1981]]
> 
> Output: 1960
> 
> Explanation: 
> 
> The maximum population is 2, and it had happened in years 1960 and 1970.
> 
> The earlier year between them is 1960.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= logs.length <= 100`
  * `1950 <= birthi < deathi <= 2050`
