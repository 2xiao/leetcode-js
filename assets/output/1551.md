# [1551. Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-array-equal/)

## 题目

You have an array `arr` of length `n` where `arr[i] = (2 * i) + 1` for all
valid values of `i` (i.e., `0 <= i < n`).

In one operation, you can select two indices `x` and `y` where `0 <= x, y < n`
and subtract `1` from `arr[x]` and add `1` to `arr[y]` (i.e., perform `arr[x]
-=1 `and `arr[y] += 1`). The goal is to make all the elements of the array
**equal**. It is **guaranteed** that all the elements of the array can be made
equal using some operations.

Given an integer `n`, the length of the array, return _the minimum number of
operations_ needed to make all the elements of arr equal.



**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 3
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: arr = [1, 3, 5]
> 
> First operation choose x = 2 and y = 0, this leads arr to be [2, 3, 4]
> 
> In the second operation choose x = 2 and y = 0 again, thus arr = [3, 3, 3].

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 6
> 
> Output: 9

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 104`
