# [2139. Minimum Moves to Reach Target Score](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-reach-target-score/)

## 题目

You are playing a game with integers. You start with the integer `1` and you
want to reach the integer `target`.

In one move, you can either:

  * **Increment** the current integer by one (i.e., `x = x + 1`).
  * **Double** the current integer (i.e., `x = 2 * x`).

You can use the **increment** operation **any** number of times, however, you
can only use the **double** operation **at most** `maxDoubles` times.

Given the two integers `target` and `maxDoubles`, return _the minimum number
of moves needed to reach_`target` _starting with_`1`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: target = 5, maxDoubles = 0
> 
> Output: 4
> 
> Explanation: Keep incrementing by 1 until you reach target.

**Example 2:**

> Input: target = 19, maxDoubles = 2
> 
> Output: 7
> 
> Explanation: Initially, x = 1
> 
> Increment 3 times so x = 4
> 
> Double once so x = 8
> 
> Increment once so x = 9
> 
> Double again so x = 18
> 
> Increment once so x = 19

**Example 3:**

> Input: target = 10, maxDoubles = 4
> 
> Output: 4
> 
> Explanation: **** Initially, x = 1
> 
> Increment once so x = 2
> 
> Double once so x = 4
> 
> Increment once so x = 5
> 
> Double again so x = 10

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= target <= 109`
  * `0 <= maxDoubles <= 100`
