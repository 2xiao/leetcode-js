# [2269. Find the K-Beauty of a Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-k-beauty-of-a-number/)

## 题目

The **k-beauty** of an integer `num` is defined as the number of
**substrings** of `num` when it is read as a string that meet the following
conditions:

- It has a length of `k`.
- It is a divisor of `num`.

Given integers `num` and `k`, return _the k-beauty of_`num`.

Note:

- **Leading zeros** are allowed.
- `0` is not a divisor of any value.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

**Example 1:**

> Input: num = 240, k = 2
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: The following are the substrings of num of length k:
>
> - "24" from " ** _24_** 0": 24 is a divisor of 240.
> - "40" from "2 _ **40**_ ": 40 is a divisor of 240.
>
> Therefore, the k-beauty is 2.

**Example 2:**

> Input: num = 430043, k = 2
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: The following are the substrings of num of length k:
>
> - "43" from " _ **43**_ 0043": 43 is a divisor of 430043.
> - "30" from "4 _ **30**_ 043": 30 is not a divisor of 430043.
> - "00" from "43 _ **00**_ 43": 0 is not a divisor of 430043.
> - "04" from "430 _ **04**_ 3": 4 is not a divisor of 430043.
> - "43" from "4300 _ **43**_ ": 43 is a divisor of 430043.
>
> Therefore, the k-beauty is 2.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= num <= 10^9`
- `1 <= k <= num.length` (taking `num` as a string)
