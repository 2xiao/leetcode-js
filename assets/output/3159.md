# [3159. Find Occurrences of an Element in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-occurrences-of-an-element-in-an-array/)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `nums`, an integer array `queries`, and an
integer `x`.

For each `queries[i]`, you need to find the index of the `queries[i]th`
occurrence of `x` in the `nums` array. If there are fewer than `queries[i]`
occurrences of `x`, the answer should be -1 for that query.

Return an integer array `answer` containing the answers to all queries.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,3,1,7], queries = [1,3,2,4], x = 1

**Output:** [0,-1,2,-1]

**Explanation:**

- For the 1st query, the first occurrence of 1 is at index 0.
- For the 2nd query, there are only two occurrences of 1 in `nums`, so the answer is -1.
- For the 3rd query, the second occurrence of 1 is at index 2.
- For the 4th query, there are only two occurrences of 1 in `nums`, so the answer is -1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3], queries = [10], x = 5

**Output:** [-1]

**Explanation:**

- For the 1st query, 5 doesn't exist in `nums`, so the answer is -1.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length, queries.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= queries[i] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i], x <= 10^4`
