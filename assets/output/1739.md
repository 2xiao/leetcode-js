# [1739. Building Boxes](https://leetcode.com/problems/building-boxes)

## 题目

You have a cubic storeroom where the width, length, and height of the room are
all equal to `n` units. You are asked to place `n` boxes in this room where
each box is a cube of unit side length. There are however some rules to
placing the boxes:

  * You can place the boxes anywhere on the floor.
  * If box `x` is placed on top of the box `y`, then each side of the four vertical sides of the box `y` **must** either be adjacent to another box or to a wall.

Given an integer `n`, return _the **minimum** possible number of boxes
touching the floor._
