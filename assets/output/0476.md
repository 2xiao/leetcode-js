# [476. Number Complement](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement)

## 题目

The **complement** of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the
`0`'s to `1`'s and all the `1`'s to `0`'s in its binary representation.

  * For example, The integer `5` is `"101"` in binary and its **complement** is `"010"` which is the integer `2`.

Given an integer `num`, return _its complement_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** num = 5
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** num = 1
    **Output:** 0
    **Explanation:** The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= num < 231`
