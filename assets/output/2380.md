# [2380. Time Needed to Rearrange a Binary String](https://leetcode.com/problems/time-needed-to-rearrange-a-binary-string/)

## 题目

You are given a binary string `s`. In one second, **all** occurrences of
`"01"` are **simultaneously** replaced with `"10"`. This process **repeats**
until no occurrences of `"01"` exist.

Return _the number of seconds needed to complete this process._



**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "0110101"
> 
> Output: 4
> 
> Explanation: 
> 
> After one second, s becomes "1011010".
> 
> After another second, s becomes "1101100".
> 
> After the third second, s becomes "1110100".
> 
> After the fourth second, s becomes "1111000".
> 
> No occurrence of "01" exists any longer, and the process needed 4 seconds to complete,
> 
> so we return 4.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "11100"
> 
> Output: 0
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> No occurrence of "01" exists in s, and the processes needed 0 seconds to complete,
> 
> so we return 0.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
  * `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
