# [1192. Critical Connections in a Network](https://leetcode.com/problems/critical-connections-in-a-network/)

## 题目

There are `n` servers numbered from `0` to `n - 1` connected by undirected
server-to-server `connections` forming a network where `connections[i] = [ai,
bi]` represents a connection between servers `ai` and `bi`. Any server can
reach other servers directly or indirectly through the network.

A _critical connection_ is a connection that, if removed, will make some
servers unable to reach some other server.

Return all critical connections in the network in any order.



**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]]
> 
> Output: [[1,3]]
> 
> Explanation: [[3,1]] is also accepted.

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 2, connections = [[0,1]]
> 
> Output: [[0,1]]

**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= n <= 105`
  * `n - 1 <= connections.length <= 105`
  * `0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1`
  * `ai != bi`
  * There are no repeated connections.
