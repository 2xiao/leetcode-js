# [997. Find the Town Judge](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge)

## 题目

In a town, there are `n` people labeled from `1` to `n`. There is a rumor that
one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

  1. The town judge trusts nobody.
  2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
  3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties **1** and **2**.

You are given an array `trust` where `trust[i] = [ai, bi]` representing that
the person labeled `ai` trusts the person labeled `bi`. If a trust
relationship does not exist in `trust` array, then such a trust relationship
does not exist.

Return _the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be
identified, or return_`-1` _otherwise_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
    **Output:** 2
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
    **Output:** 3
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
    **Output:** -1
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 1000`
  * `0 <= trust.length <= 104`
  * `trust[i].length == 2`
  * All the pairs of `trust` are **unique**.
  * `ai != bi`
  * `1 <= ai, bi <= n`
