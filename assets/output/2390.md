# [2390. Removing Stars From a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/removing-stars-from-a-string)

## 题目

You are given a string `s`, which contains stars `*`.

In one operation, you can:

  * Choose a star in `s`.
  * Remove the closest **non-star** character to its **left** , as well as remove the star itself.

Return _the string after **all** stars have been removed_.

**Note:**

  * The input will be generated such that the operation is always possible.
  * It can be shown that the resulting string will always be unique.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "leet**cod*e"
    **Output:** "lecoe"
    **Explanation:** Performing the removals from left to right:
    - The closest character to the 1st star is 't' in "lee ** _t_** **cod*e". s becomes "lee*cod*e".
    - The closest character to the 2nd star is 'e' in "le ** _e_** *cod*e". s becomes "lecod*e".
    - The closest character to the 3rd star is 'd' in "leco ** _d_** *e". s becomes "lecoe".
    There are no more stars, so we return "lecoe".

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "erase*****"
    **Output:** ""
    **Explanation:** The entire string is removed, so we return an empty string.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `s` consists of lowercase English letters and stars `*`.
  * The operation above can be performed on `s`.
