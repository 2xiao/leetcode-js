# [2488. Count Subarrays With Median K](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-subarrays-with-median-k/)

## 题目

You are given an array `nums` of size `n` consisting of **distinct** integers
from `1` to `n` and a positive integer `k`.

Return _the number of non-empty subarrays in_`nums` _that have a **median**
equal to _`k`.

**Note** :

- The median of an array is the **middle** element after sorting the array in **ascending** order. If the array is of even length, the median is the **left** middle element.
  > - For example, the median of `[2,3,1,4]` is `2`, and the median of `[8,4,3,5,1]` is `4`.
- A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [3,2,1,4,5], k = 4
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: The subarrays that have a median equal to 4 are: [4], [4,5] and [1,4,5].

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [2,3,1], k = 3
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation: [3] is the only subarray that has a median equal to 3.

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i], k <= n`
- The integers in `nums` are distinct.
