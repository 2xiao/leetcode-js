# [2274. Maximum Consecutive Floors Without Special Floors](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-consecutive-floors-without-special-floors)

## 题目

Alice manages a company and has rented some floors of a building as office
space. Alice has decided some of these floors should be **special floors** ,
used for relaxation only.

You are given two integers `bottom` and `top`, which denote that Alice has
rented all the floors from `bottom` to `top` ( **inclusive** ). You are also
given the integer array `special`, where `special[i]` denotes a special floor
that Alice has designated for relaxation.

Return _the **maximum** number of consecutive floors without a special floor_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: bottom = 2, top = 9, special = [4,6]
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation: The following are the ranges (inclusive) of consecutive floors without a special floor:
> - (2, 3) with a total amount of 2 floors.
> - (5, 5) with a total amount of 1 floor.
> - (7, 9) with a total amount of 3 floors.
> 
> Therefore, we return the maximum number which is 3 floors.

**Example 2:**

> Input: bottom = 6, top = 8, special = [7,6,8]
> 
> Output: 0
> 
> Explanation: Every floor rented is a special floor, so we return 0.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= special.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= bottom <= special[i] <= top <= 109`
  * All the values of `special` are **unique**.
