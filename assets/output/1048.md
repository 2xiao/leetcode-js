# [1048. Longest String Chain](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-string-chain/)

## 题目

You are given an array of `words` where each word consists of lowercase
English letters.

`wordA` is a **predecessor** of `wordB` if and only if we can insert **exactly
one** letter anywhere in `wordA` **without changing the order of the other
characters** to make it equal to `wordB`.

  * For example, `"abc"` is a **predecessor** of `"ab _a_ c"`, while `"cba"` is not a **predecessor** of `"bcad"`.

A **word chain** __ is a sequence of words `[word1, word2, ..., wordk]` with
`k >= 1`, where `word1` is a **predecessor** of `word2`, `word2` is a
**predecessor** of `word3`, and so on. A single word is trivially a **word
chain** with `k == 1`.

Return _the **length** of the **longest possible word chain** with words
chosen from the given list of _`words`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: words = ["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]
> 
> Output: 4
> 
> **Explanation** : One of the longest word chains is ["a"," _b_ a","b _d_ a","bd _c_ a"].

**Example 2:**

> Input: words = ["xbc","pcxbcf","xb","cxbc","pcxbc"]
> 
> Output: 5
> 
> Explanation: All the words can be put in a word chain ["xb", "xb _c_ ", " _c_ xbc", " _p_ cxbc", "pcxbc _f_ "].

**Example 3:**

> Input: words = ["abcd","dbqca"]
> 
> Output: 1
> 
> Explanation: The trivial word chain ["abcd"] is one of the longest word chains.
> 
> ["abcd","dbqca"] is not a valid word chain because the ordering of the letters is changed.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
  * `1 <= words[i].length <= 16`
  * `words[i]` only consists of lowercase English letters.
