# [374. Guess Number Higher or Lower](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/)

## 题目

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is
higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`, which returns three possible
results:

  * `-1`: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. `num > pick`).
  * `1`: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. `num < pick`).
  * `0`: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. `num == pick`).

Return _the number that I picked_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 10, pick = 6
> 
> Output: 6

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 1, pick = 1
> 
> Output: 1

**Example 3:**

> Input: n = 2, pick = 1
> 
> Output: 1

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 231 - 1`
  * `1 <= pick <= n`
