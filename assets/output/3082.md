# [3082. Find the Sum of the Power of All Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-sum-of-the-power-of-all-subsequences/)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and a **positive** integer
`k`.

The **power** of an array of integers is defined as the number of subsequences
with their sum **equal** to `k`.

Return _the**sum** of **power** of all subsequences of_ `nums` _._

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3], k = 3

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

There are `5` subsequences of nums with non-zero power:

- The subsequence `[_**1**_ ,_**2**_ ,_**3**_]` has `2` subsequences with `sum == 3`: `[1,2,_3_]` and `[_1_ ,_2_ ,3]`.
- The subsequence `[_**1**_ ,2,_**3**_]` has `1` subsequence with `sum == 3`: `[1,2,_3_]`.
- The subsequence `[1,_**2**_ ,_**3**_]` has `1` subsequence with `sum == 3`: `[1,2,_3_]`.
- The subsequence `[_**1**_ ,_**2**_ ,3]` has `1` subsequence with `sum == 3`: `[_1_ ,_2_ ,3]`.
- The subsequence `[1,2,_**3**_]` has `1` subsequence with `sum == 3`: `[1,2,_3_]`.

Hence the answer is `2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2,3,3], k = 5

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

There are `3` subsequences of nums with non-zero power:

- The subsequence `[_**2**_ ,_**3**_ ,_**3**_]` has 2 subsequences with `sum == 5`: `[_2_ ,3,_3_]` and `[_2_ ,_3_ ,3]`.
- The subsequence `[_**2**_ ,3,_**3**_]` has 1 subsequence with `sum == 5`: `[_2_ ,3,_3_]`.
- The subsequence `[_**2**_ ,_**3**_ ,3]` has 1 subsequence with `sum == 5`: `[_2_ ,_3_ ,3]`.

Hence the answer is `2 + 1 + 1 = 4`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3], k = 7

**Output:** 0

**Explanation: **There exists no subsequence with sum `7`. Hence all
subsequences of nums have `power = 0`.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `1 <= k <= 100`
