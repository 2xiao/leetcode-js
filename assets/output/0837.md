# [837. New 21 Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/new-21-game)

## 题目

Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game **" 21"**.

Alice starts with `0` points and draws numbers while she has less than `k`
points. During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from
the range `[1, maxPts]`, where `maxPts` is an integer. Each draw is
independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.

Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets `k` **or more points**.

Return the probability that Alice has `n` or fewer points.

Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer are considered accepted.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 10, k = 1, maxPts = 10
    **Output:** 1.00000
    **Explanation:** Alice gets a single card, then stops.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 6, k = 1, maxPts = 10
    **Output:** 0.60000
    **Explanation:** Alice gets a single card, then stops.
    In 6 out of 10 possibilities, she is at or below 6 points.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 21, k = 17, maxPts = 10
    **Output:** 0.73278
    



**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= k <= n <= 104`
  * `1 <= maxPts <= 104`
