## 题目

A newly designed keypad was tested, where a tester pressed a sequence of `n`
keys, one at a time.

You are given a string `keysPressed` of length `n`, where `keysPressed[i]` was
the `ith` key pressed in the testing sequence, and a sorted list
`releaseTimes`, where `releaseTimes[i]` was the time the `ith` key was
released. Both arrays are **0-indexed**. The `0th` key was pressed at the time
`0`, and every subsequent key was pressed at the **exact** time the previous
key was released.

The tester wants to know the key of the keypress that had the **longest
duration**. The `ith` keypress had a **duration** of `releaseTimes[i] -
releaseTimes[i - 1]`, and the `0th` keypress had a duration of
`releaseTimes[0]`.

Note that the same key could have been pressed multiple times during the test,
and these multiple presses of the same key **may not** have had the same
**duration**.

_Return the key of the keypress that had the**longest duration**. If there are
multiple such keypresses, return the lexicographically largest key of the
keypresses._



**Example 1:**

> Input: releaseTimes = [9,29,49,50], keysPressed = "cbcd"
> 
> Output: "c"
> 
> Explanation: The keypresses were as follows:
> 
> Keypress for 'c' had a duration of 9 (pressed at time 0 and released at time 9).
> 
> Keypress for 'b' had a duration of 29 - 9 = 20 (pressed at time 9 right after the release of the previous character and released at time 29).
> 
> Keypress for 'c' had a duration of 49 - 29 = 20 (pressed at time 29 right after the release of the previous character and released at time 49).
> 
> Keypress for 'd' had a duration of 50 - 49 = 1 (pressed at time 49 right after the release of the previous character and released at time 50).
> 
> The longest of these was the keypress for 'b' and the second keypress for 'c', both with duration 20.
> 
> 'c' is lexicographically larger than 'b', so the answer is 'c'.

**Example 2:**

> Input: releaseTimes = [12,23,36,46,62], keysPressed = "spuda"
> 
> Output: "a"
> 
> Explanation: The keypresses were as follows:
> 
> Keypress for 's' had a duration of 12.
> 
> Keypress for 'p' had a duration of 23 - 12 = 11.
> 
> Keypress for 'u' had a duration of 36 - 23 = 13.
> 
> Keypress for 'd' had a duration of 46 - 36 = 10.
> 
> Keypress for 'a' had a duration of 62 - 46 = 16.
> 
> The longest of these was the keypress for 'a' with duration 16.



**Constraints:**

  * `releaseTimes.length == n`
  * `keysPressed.length == n`
  * `2 <= n <= 1000`
  * `1 <= releaseTimes[i] <= 10^9`
  * `releaseTimes[i] < releaseTimes[i+1]`
  * `keysPressed` contains only lowercase English letters.


## 题目大意

LeetCode 设计了一款新式键盘，正在测试其可用性。测试人员将会点击一系列键（总计 `n` 个），每次一个。

给你一个长度为 `n` 的字符串 `keysPressed` ，其中 `keysPressed[i]` 表示测试序列中第 `i`
个被按下的键。`releaseTimes` 是一个升序排列的列表，其中 `releaseTimes[i]` 表示松开第 `i` 个键的时间。字符串和数组的
**下标都从 0 开始** 。第 `0` 个键在时间为 `0` 时被按下，接下来每个键都 **恰好** 在前一个键松开时被按下。

测试人员想要找出按键 **持续时间最长** 的键。第 `i` 次按键的持续时间为 `releaseTimes[i] - releaseTimes[i -
1]` ，第 `0` 次按键的持续时间为 `releaseTimes[0]` 。

注意，测试期间，同一个键可以在不同时刻被多次按下，而每次的持续时间都可能不同。

请返回单次按键 **持续时间最长** 的键，如果有多个这样的键，则返回 **按字母顺序排列最大** 的那个键。



**示例 1：**

> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> **输入：** releaseTimes = [9,29,49,50], keysPressed = "cbcd"
> 
> **输出：** "c"
> 
> **解释：** 按键顺序和持续时间如下：
> 
> 按下 'c' ，持续时间 9（时间 0 按下，时间 9 松开）
> 
> 按下 'b' ，持续时间 29 - 9 = 20（松开上一个键的时间 9 按下，时间 29 松开）
> 
> 按下 'c' ，持续时间 49 - 29 = 20（松开上一个键的时间 29 按下，时间 49 松开）
> 
> 按下 'd' ，持续时间 50 - 49 = 1（松开上一个键的时间 49 按下，时间 50 松开）
> 
> 按键持续时间最长的键是 'b' 和 'c'（第二次按下时），持续时间都是 20
> 
> 'c' 按字母顺序排列比 'b' 大，所以答案是 'c'
>

**示例 2：**

> 
> 
>

> 
> **输入：** releaseTimes = [12,23,36,46,62], keysPressed = "spuda"
> 
> **输出：** "a"

> 
> 按下 'd' ，持续时间 46 - 36 = 10
> 
> 按下 'a' ，持续时间 62 - 46 = 16
> 
> 按键持续时间最长的键是 'a' ，持续时间 16



**提示：**

  * `releaseTimes.length == n`
  * `keysPressed.length == n`
  * `2 <= n <= 1000`
  * `1 <= releaseTimes[i] <= 10^9`
  * `releaseTimes[i] < releaseTimes[i+1]`
  * `keysPressed` 仅由小写英文字母组成
