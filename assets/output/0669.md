# [669. Trim a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/trim-a-binary-search-tree)

## 题目

Given the `root` of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries
as `low` and `high`, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in `[low,
high]`. Trimming the tree should **not** change the relative structure of the
elements that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendant should
remain a descendant). It can be proven that there is a **unique answer**.

Return _the root of the trimmed binary search tree_. Note that the root may
change depending on the given bounds.



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** root = [1,0,2], low = 1, high = 2
    **Output:** [1,null,2]
    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/09/trim2.jpg)

    
    
    **Input:** root = [3,0,4,null,2,null,null,1], low = 1, high = 3
    **Output:** [3,2,null,1]
    



**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
  * `0 <= Node.val <= 104`
  * The value of each node in the tree is **unique**.
  * `root` is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
  * `0 <= low <= high <= 104`
