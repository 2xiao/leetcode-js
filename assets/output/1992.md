# [1992. Find All Groups of Farmland](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-groups-of-farmland)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** `m x n` binary matrix `land` where a `0`
represents a hectare of forested land and a `1` represents a hectare of
farmland.

To keep the land organized, there are designated rectangular areas of hectares
that consist **entirely** of farmland. These rectangular areas are called
**groups**. No two groups are adjacent, meaning farmland in one group is
**not** four-directionally adjacent to another farmland in a different group.

`land` can be represented by a coordinate system where the top left corner of
`land` is `(0, 0)` and the bottom right corner of `land` is `(m-1, n-1)`. Find
the coordinates of the top left and bottom right corner of each **group** of
farmland. A **group** of farmland with a top left corner at `(r1, c1)` and a
bottom right corner at `(r2, c2)` is represented by the 4-length array `[r1,
c1, r2, c2].`

Return _a 2D array containing the 4-length arrays described above for each
**group** of farmland in _`land` _. If there are no groups of farmland, return
an empty array. You may return the answer in **any order**_.

    **Input:** land = [[1,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,1,1]]
    **Output:** [[0,0,0,0],[1,1,2,2]]
    **Explanation:**
    The first group has a top left corner at land[0][0] and a bottom right corner at land[0][0].
    The second group has a top left corner at land[1][1] and a bottom right corner at land[2][2].
    

**Example 2:**

    **Input:** land = [[1,1],[1,1]]
    **Output:** [[0,0,1,1]]
    **Explanation:**
    The first group has a top left corner at land[0][0] and a bottom right corner at land[1][1].

    **Input:** land = [[0]]
    **Output:** []
    **Explanation:**
    There are no groups of farmland.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `m == land.length`
  * `n == land[i].length`
  * `1 <= m, n <= 300`
  * `land` consists of only `0`'s and `1`'s.
  * Groups of farmland are **rectangular** in shape.
