# [2100. Find Good Days to Rob the Bank](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-good-days-to-rob-the-bank/)

## 题目

You and a gang of thieves are planning on robbing a bank. You are given a
**0-indexed** integer array `security`, where `security[i]` is the number of
guards on duty on the `ith` day. The days are numbered starting from `0`. You
are also given an integer `time`.

The `ith` day is a good day to rob the bank if:

  * There are at least `time` days before and after the `ith` day,
  * The number of guards at the bank for the `time` days **before** `i` are **non-increasing** , and
  * The number of guards at the bank for the `time` days **after** `i` are **non-decreasing**.

More formally, this means day `i` is a good day to rob the bank if and only if
`security[i - time] >= security[i - time + 1] >= ... >= security[i] <= ... <=
security[i + time - 1] <= security[i + time]`.

Return _a list of **all** days **(0-indexed)** that are good days to rob the
bank_. _The order that the days are returned in does ******not** matter._



**Example 1:**

> Input: security = [5,3,3,3,5,6,2], time = 2
> 
> Output: [2,3]
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> On day 2, we have security[0] >= security[1] >= security[2] <= security[3] <= security[4].
> 
> On day 3, we have security[1] >= security[2] >= security[3] <= security[4] <= security[5].
> 
> No other days satisfy this condition, so days 2 and 3 are the only good days to rob the bank.

**Example 2:**

> Input: security = [1,1,1,1,1], time = 0
> 
> Output: [0,1,2,3,4]
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> Since time equals 0, every day is a good day to rob the bank, so return every day.

**Example 3:**

> Input: security = [1,2,3,4,5,6], time = 2
> 
> Output: []
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> No day has 2 days before it that have a non-increasing number of guards.
> 
> Thus, no day is a good day to rob the bank, so return an empty list.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= security.length <= 105`
  * `0 <= security[i], time <= 105`
