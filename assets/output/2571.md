# [2571. Minimum Operations to Reduce an Integer to 0](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-reduce-an-integer-to-0)

## 题目

You are given a positive integer `n`, you can do the following operation
**any** number of times:

  * Add or subtract a **power** of `2` from `n`.

Return _the **minimum** number of operations to make _`n` _equal to_`0`.

A number `x` is power of `2` if `x == 2i` where `i >= 0` _._



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 39
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** We can do the following operations:
    - Add 20 = 1 to n, so now n = 40.
    - Subtract 23 = 8 from n, so now n = 32.
    - Subtract 25 = 32 from n, so now n = 0.
    It can be shown that 3 is the minimum number of operations we need to make n equal to 0.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 54
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** We can do the following operations:
    - Add 21 = 2 to n, so now n = 56.
    - Add 23 = 8 to n, so now n = 64.
    - Subtract 26 = 64 from n, so now n = 0.
    So the minimum number of operations is 3.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 105`
