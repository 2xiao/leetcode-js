# [1906. Minimum Absolute Difference Queries](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-queries/)

## 题目

The **minimum absolute difference** of an array `a` is defined as the
**minimum value** of `|a[i] - a[j]|`, where `0 <= i < j < a.length` and `a[i]
!= a[j]`. If all elements of `a` are the **same** , the minimum absolute
difference is `-1`.

- For example, the minimum absolute difference of the array `[5, _2_ , _3_ ,7,2]` is `|2 - 3| = 1`. Note that it is not `0` because `a[i]` and `a[j]` must be different.

You are given an integer array `nums` and the array `queries` where
`queries[i] = [li, ri]`. For each query `i`, compute the **minimum absolute
difference** of the **subarray** `nums[li...ri]` containing the elements of
`nums` between the **0-based** indices `li` and `ri` ( **inclusive** ).

Return _an **array** _`ans` _where_ `ans[i]` _is the answer to the_ `ith`
_query_.

A **subarray** is a contiguous sequence of elements in an array.

The value of `|x|` is defined as:

- `x` if `x >= 0`.
- `-x` if `x < 0`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [1,3,4,8], queries = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[0,3]]
>
> Output: [2,1,4,1]
>
> Explanation: The queries are processed as follows:
>
> - queries[0] = [0,1]: The subarray is [ _1_ , _3_ ] and the minimum absolute difference is |1-3| = 2.
> - queries[1] = [1,2]: The subarray is [ _3_ , _4_ ] and the minimum absolute difference is |3-4| = 1.
> - queries[2] = [2,3]: The subarray is [ _4_ , _8_ ] and the minimum absolute difference is |4-8| = 4.
> - queries[3] = [0,3]: The subarray is [1, _3_ , _4_ ,8] and the minimum absolute difference is |3-4| = 1.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [4,5,2,2,7,10], queries = [[2,3],[0,2],[0,5],[3,5]]
>
> Output: [-1,1,1,3]
>
> Explanation: The queries are processed as follows:
>
> - queries[0] = [2,3]: The subarray is [2,2] and the minimum absolute difference is -1 because all the
>
>   elements are the same.
>
> - queries[1] = [0,2]: The subarray is [ _4_ , _5_ ,2] and the minimum absolute difference is |4-5| = 1.
> - queries[2] = [0,5]: The subarray is [ _4_ , _5_ ,2,2,7,10] and the minimum absolute difference is |4-5| = 1.
> - queries[3] = [3,5]: The subarray is [2, _7_ , _10_ ] and the minimum absolute difference is |7-10| = 3.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `0 <= li < ri < nums.length`
