# [2924. Find Champion II](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-champion-ii)

## 题目

There are `n` teams numbered from `0` to `n - 1` in a tournament; each team is
also a node in a **DAG**.

You are given the integer `n` and a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `edges` of
length `m` representing the **DAG** , where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates
that there is a directed edge from team `ui` to team `vi` in the graph.

A directed edge from `a` to `b` in the graph means that team `a` is
**stronger** than team `b` and team `b` is **weaker** than team `a`.

Team `a` will be the **champion** of the tournament if there is no team `b`
that is **stronger** than team `a`.

Return _the team that will be the **champion** of the tournament if there is a
**unique** champion, otherwise, return _`-1` _._

**Notes**

  * A **cycle** is a series of nodes `a1, a2, ..., an, an+1` such that node `a1` is the same node as node `an+1`, the nodes `a1, a2, ..., an` are distinct, and there is a directed edge from the node `ai` to node `ai+1` for every `i` in the range `[1, n]`.
  * A **DAG** is a directed graph that does not have any **cycle**.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/10/19/graph-3.png)

    
    
    **Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]]
    **Output:** 0
    **Explanation:** Team 1 is weaker than team 0. Team 2 is weaker than team 1. So the champion is team 0.
    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/10/19/graph-4.png)

    
    
    **Input:** n = 4, edges = [[0,2],[1,3],[1,2]]
    **Output:** -1
    **Explanation:** Team 2 is weaker than team 0 and team 1. Team 3 is weaker than team 1. But team 1 and team 0 are not weaker than any other teams. So the answer is -1.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 100`
  * `m == edges.length`
  * `0 <= m <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
  * `edges[i].length == 2`
  * `0 <= edge[i][j] <= n - 1`
  * `edges[i][0] != edges[i][1]`
  * The input is generated such that if team `a` is stronger than team `b`, team `b` is not stronger than team `a`.
  * The input is generated such that if team `a` is stronger than team `b` and team `b` is stronger than team `c`, then team `a` is stronger than team `c`.
