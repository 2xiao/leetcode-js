# [791. Custom Sort String](https://leetcode.com/problems/custom-sort-string/)

## 题目

You are given two strings order and s. All the characters of `order` are
**unique** and were sorted in some custom order previously.

Permute the characters of `s` so that they match the order that `order` was
sorted. More specifically, if a character `x` occurs before a character `y` in
`order`, then `x` should occur before `y` in the permuted string.

Return _any permutation of_`s` _that satisfies this property_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: order = "cba", s = "abcd"
>
> Output: "cbad"
>
> Explanation:
>
> "a", "b", "c" appear in order, so the order of "a", "b", "c" should be "c", "b", and "a".
>
> Since "d" does not appear in order, it can be at any position in the returned string. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" are also valid outputs.

**Example 2:**

> Input: order = "cbafg", s = "abcd"
>
> Output: "cbad"

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= order.length <= 26`
- `1 <= s.length <= 200`
- `order` and `s` consist of lowercase English letters.
- All the characters of `order` are **unique**.
