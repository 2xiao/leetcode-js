# [543. Diameter of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)

## 题目

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the length of the **diameter** of
the tree_.

The **diameter** of a binary tree is the **length** of the longest path
between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the
`root`.

The **length** of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of
edges between them.



**Example 1:**

> Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

**Example 2:**

> Input: root = [1,2]
> 
> Output: 1

**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
  * `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
