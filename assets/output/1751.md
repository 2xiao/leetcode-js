# [1751. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended II](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-events-that-can-be-attended-ii)

## 题目

You are given an array of `events` where `events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi,
valuei]`. The `ith` event starts at `startDayi` and ends at `endDayi`, and if
you attend this event, you will receive a value of `valuei`. You are also
given an integer `k` which represents the maximum number of events you can
attend.

You can only attend one event at a time. If you choose to attend an event, you
must attend the **entire** event. Note that the end day is **inclusive** :
that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other
ends on the same day.

Return _the **maximum sum** of values that you can receive by attending
events._



**Example 1:**

> Input: events = [[1,2,4],[3,4,3],[2,3,1]], k = 2
> 
> Output: 7
> 
> Explanation: Choose the green events, 0 and 1 (0-indexed) for a total value of 4 + 3 = 7.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/10/screenshot-2021-01-11-at-60150-pm.png)

> Input: events = [[1,2,4],[3,4,3],[2,3,10]], k = 2
> 
> Output: 10
> 
> Explanation: Choose event 2 for a total value of 10.
> 
> Notice that you cannot attend any other event as they overlap, and that you do **not** have to attend k events.

**Example 3:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/10/screenshot-2021-01-11-at-60703-pm.png)**

> Input: events = [[1,1,1],[2,2,2],[3,3,3],[4,4,4]], k = 3
> 
> Output: 9
> 
> Explanation: Although the events do not overlap, you can only attend 3 events. Pick the highest valued three.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= k <= events.length`
  * `1 <= k * events.length <= 106`
  * `1 <= startDayi <= endDayi <= 109`
  * `1 <= valuei <= 106`
