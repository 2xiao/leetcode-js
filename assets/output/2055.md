# [2055. Plates Between Candles](https://leetcode.com/problems/plates-between-candles)

## 题目

There is a long table with a line of plates and candles arranged on top of it.
You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` consisting of characters `'*'` and
`'|'` only, where a `'*'` represents a **plate** and a `'|'` represents a
**candle**.

You are also given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `queries` where
`queries[i] = [lefti, righti]` denotes the **substring** `s[lefti...righti]` (
**inclusive** ). For each query, you need to find the **number** of plates
**between candles** that are **in the substring**. A plate is considered
**between candles** if there is at least one candle to its left **and** at
least one candle to its right **in the substring**.

  * For example, `s = "||**||**|*"`, and a query `[3, 8]` denotes the substring `"*|| ** _**_** |"`. The number of plates between candles in this substring is `2`, as each of the two plates has at least one candle **in the substring** to its left **and** right.

Return _an integer array_ `answer` _where_ `answer[i]` _is the answer to the_
`ith` _query_.



**Example 1:**

![ex-1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/04/ex-1.png)

    
    
    **Input:** s = "**|**|***|", queries = [[2,5],[5,9]]
    **Output:** [2,3]
    **Explanation:**
    - queries[0] has two plates between candles.
    - queries[1] has three plates between candles.
    

**Example 2:**

![ex-2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/04/ex-2.png)

    
    
    **Input:** s = "***|**|*****|**||**|*", queries = [[1,17],[4,5],[14,17],[5,11],[15,16]]
    **Output:** [9,0,0,0,0]
    **Explanation:**
    - queries[0] has nine plates between candles.
    - The other queries have zero plates between candles.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `3 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `s` consists of `'*'` and `'|'` characters.
  * `1 <= queries.length <= 105`
  * `queries[i].length == 2`
  * `0 <= lefti <= righti < s.length`
