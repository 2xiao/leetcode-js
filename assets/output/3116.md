# [3116. Kth Smallest Amount With Single Denomination Combination](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-amount-with-single-denomination-combination/)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different
denominations and an integer `k`.

You have an infinite number of coins of each denomination. However, you are
**not allowed** to combine coins of different denominations.

Return the `kth` **smallest** amount that can be made using these coins.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** coins = [3,6,9], k = 3

**Output:** 9

**Explanation:** The given coins can make the following amounts:  
Coin 3 produces multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, etc.  
Coin 6 produces multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, etc.  
Coin 9 produces multiples of 9: 9, 18, 27, 36, etc.  
All of the coins combined produce: 3, 6, _**9**_ , 12, 15, etc.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** coins = [5,2], k = 7

**Output:** 12

**Explanation:** The given coins can make the following amounts:  
Coin 5 produces multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, etc.  
Coin 2 produces multiples of 2: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, etc.  
All of the coins combined produce: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, _**12**_ , 14, 15, etc.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= coins.length <= 15`
- `1 <= coins[i] <= 25`
- `1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9`
- `coins` contains pairwise distinct integers.
