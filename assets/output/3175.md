## 题目

A competition consists of `n` players numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given an integer array `skills` of size `n` and a **positive** integer
`k`, where `skills[i]` is the skill level of player `i`. All integers in
`skills` are **unique**.

All players are standing in a queue in order from player `0` to player `n -
1`.

The competition process is as follows:

  * The first two players in the queue play a game, and the player with the **higher** skill level wins.
  * After the game, the winner stays at the beginning of the queue, and the loser goes to the end of it.

The winner of the competition is the **first** player who wins `k` games **in
a row**.

Return the initial index of the _winning_ player.



**Example 1:**

**Input:** skills = [4,2,6,3,9], k = 2

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

Initially, the queue of players is `[0,1,2,3,4]`. The following process
happens:

  * Players 0 and 1 play a game, since the skill of player 0 is higher than that of player 1, player 0 wins. The resulting queue is `[0,2,3,4,1]`.
  * Players 0 and 2 play a game, since the skill of player 2 is higher than that of player 0, player 2 wins. The resulting queue is `[2,3,4,1,0]`.
  * Players 2 and 3 play a game, since the skill of player 2 is higher than that of player 3, player 2 wins. The resulting queue is `[2,4,1,0,3]`.

Player 2 won `k = 2` games in a row, so the winner is player 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** skills = [2,5,4], k = 3

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

Initially, the queue of players is `[0,1,2]`. The following process happens:

  * Players 0 and 1 play a game, since the skill of player 1 is higher than that of player 0, player 1 wins. The resulting queue is `[1,2,0]`.
  * Players 1 and 2 play a game, since the skill of player 1 is higher than that of player 2, player 1 wins. The resulting queue is `[1,0,2]`.
  * Players 1 and 0 play a game, since the skill of player 1 is higher than that of player 0, player 1 wins. The resulting queue is `[1,2,0]`.

Player 1 won `k = 3` games in a row, so the winner is player 1.



**Constraints:**

  * `n == skills.length`
  * `2 <= n <= 10^5`
  * `1 <= k <= 10^9`
  * `1 <= skills[i] <= 10^6`
  * All integers in `skills` are unique.


## 题目大意

有 `n` 位玩家在进行比赛，玩家编号依次为 `0` 到 `n - 1` 。

给你一个长度为 `n` 的整数数组 `skills` 和一个 **正**  整数 `k` ，其中 `skills[i]` 是第 `i`
位玩家的技能等级。`skills` 中所有整数 **互不相同**  。

所有玩家从编号 `0` 到 `n - 1` 排成一列。

比赛进行方式如下：

  * 队列中最前面两名玩家进行一场比赛，技能等级 **更高**  的玩家胜出。
  * 比赛后，获胜者保持在队列的开头，而失败者排到队列的末尾。

这个比赛的赢家是 **第一位连续**  赢下 `k` 场比赛的玩家。

请你返回这个比赛的赢家编号。



**示例 1：**

**输入：** skills = [4,2,6,3,9], k = 2

**输出：** 2

**解释：**

一开始，队列里的玩家为 `[0,1,2,3,4]` 。比赛过程如下：

  * 玩家 0 和 1 进行一场比赛，玩家 0 的技能等级高于玩家 1 ，玩家 0 胜出，队列变为 `[0,2,3,4,1]` 。
  * 玩家 0 和 2 进行一场比赛，玩家 2 的技能等级高于玩家 0 ，玩家 2 胜出，队列变为 `[2,3,4,1,0]` 。
  * 玩家 2 和 3 进行一场比赛，玩家 2 的技能等级高于玩家 3 ，玩家 2 胜出，队列变为 `[2,4,1,0,3]` 。

玩家 2 连续赢了 `k = 2` 场比赛，所以赢家是玩家 2 。

**示例 2：**

**输入：** skills = [2,5,4], k = 3

**输出：** 1

**解释：**

一开始，队列里的玩家为 `[0,1,2]` 。比赛过程如下：

  * 玩家 0 和 1 进行一场比赛，玩家 1 的技能等级高于玩家 0 ，玩家 1 胜出，队列变为 `[1,2,0]` 。
  * 玩家 1 和 2 进行一场比赛，玩家 1 的技能等级高于玩家 2 ，玩家 1 胜出，队列变为 `[1,0,2]` 。
  * 玩家 1 和 0 进行一场比赛，玩家 1 的技能等级高于玩家 0 ，玩家 1 胜出，队列变为 `[1,2,0]` 。

玩家 1 连续赢了 `k = 3` 场比赛，所以赢家是玩家 1 。



**提示：**

  * `n == skills.length`
  * `2 <= n <= 10^5`
  * `1 <= k <= 10^9`
  * `1 <= skills[i] <= 10^6`
  * `skills` 中的整数互不相同。
