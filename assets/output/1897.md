# [1897. Redistribute Characters to Make All Strings Equal](https://leetcode.com/problems/redistribute-characters-to-make-all-strings-equal)

## 题目

You are given an array of strings `words` ( **0-indexed** ).

In one operation, pick two **distinct** indices `i` and `j`, where `words[i]`
is a non-empty string, and move **any** character from `words[i]` to **any**
position in `words[j]`.

Return `true` _if you can make **every** string in _`words` _**equal** using
**any** number of operations_, _and_`false` _otherwise_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: words = ["abc","aabc","bc"]
> 
> Output: true
> 
> Explanation: Move the first 'a' in words[1] to the front of words[2],
> 
> to make words[1] = "abc" and words[2] = "abc".
> 
> All the strings are now equal to "abc", so return true.

**Example 2:**

> Input: words = ["ab","a"]
> 
> Output: false
> 
> Explanation: It is impossible to make all the strings equal using the operation.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= words.length <= 100`
  * `1 <= words[i].length <= 100`
  * `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
