# [424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/)

## 题目

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can choose any character of
the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can
perform this operation at most `k` times.

Return _the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can
get after performing the above operations_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
>
> Output: 4
>
> Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
>
> Output: 4
>
> Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
>
> The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
>
> There may exists other ways to achieve this answer too.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists of only uppercase English letters.
- `0 <= k <= s.length`
