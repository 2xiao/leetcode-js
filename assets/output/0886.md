# [886. Possible Bipartition](https://leetcode.com/problems/possible-bipartition)

## 题目

We want to split a group of `n` people (labeled from `1` to `n`) into two
groups of **any size**. Each person may dislike some other people, and they
should not go into the same group.

Given the integer `n` and the array `dislikes` where `dislikes[i] = [ai, bi]`
indicates that the person labeled `ai` does not like the person labeled `bi`,
return `true` _if it is possible to split everyone into two groups in this
way_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 4, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]]
    **Output:** true
    **Explanation:** The first group has [1,4], and the second group has [2,3].
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 3, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
    **Output:** false
    **Explanation:** We need at least 3 groups to divide them. We cannot put them in two groups.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 2000`
  * `0 <= dislikes.length <= 104`
  * `dislikes[i].length == 2`
  * `1 <= ai < bi <= n`
  * All the pairs of `dislikes` are **unique**.
