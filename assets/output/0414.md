# [414. Third Maximum Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/third-maximum-number)

## 题目

Given an integer array `nums`, return _the **third distinct maximum** number
in this array. If the third maximum does not exist, return the **maximum**
number_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [3,2,1]
    **Output:** 1
    **Explanation:**
    The first distinct maximum is 3.
    The second distinct maximum is 2.
    The third distinct maximum is 1.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [1,2]
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:**
    The first distinct maximum is 2.
    The second distinct maximum is 1.
    The third distinct maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [2,2,3,1]
    **Output:** 1
    **Explanation:**
    The first distinct maximum is 3.
    The second distinct maximum is 2 (both 2's are counted together since they have the same value).
    The third distinct maximum is 1.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
  * `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`



**Follow up:** Can you find an `O(n)` solution?
