# [1024. Video Stitching](https://leetcode.com/problems/video-stitching/)

## 题目

You are given a series of video clips from a sporting event that lasted `time`
seconds. These video clips can be overlapping with each other and have varying
lengths.

Each video clip is described by an array `clips` where `clips[i] = [starti,
endi]` indicates that the ith clip started at `starti` and ended at `endi`.

We can cut these clips into segments freely.

- For example, a clip `[0, 7]` can be cut into segments `[0, 1] + [1, 3] + [3, 7]`.

Return _the minimum number of clips needed so that we can cut the clips into
segments that cover the entire sporting event_ `[0, time]`. If the task is
impossible, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: clips = [[0,2],[4,6],[8,10],[1,9],[1,5],[5,9]], time = 10
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: We take the clips [0,2], [8,10], [1,9]; a total of 3 clips.
>
> Then, we can reconstruct the sporting event as follows:
>
> We cut [1,9] into segments [1,2] + [2,8] + [8,9].
>
> Now we have segments [0,2] + [2,8] + [8,10] which cover the sporting event [0, 10].

**Example 2:**

> Input: clips = [[0,1],[1,2]], time = 5
>
> Output: -1
>
> Explanation: We cannot cover [0,5] with only [0,1] and [1,2].

**Example 3:**

> Input: clips = [[0,1],[6,8],[0,2],[5,6],[0,4],[0,3],[6,7],[1,3],[4,7],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6],[3,4],[4,5],[5,7],[6,9]], time = 9
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: We can take clips [0,4], [4,7], and [6,9].

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= clips.length <= 100`
- `0 <= starti <= endi <= 100`
- `1 <= time <= 100`
