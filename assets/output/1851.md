# [1851. Minimum Interval to Include Each Query](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-interval-to-include-each-query)

## 题目

You are given a 2D integer array `intervals`, where `intervals[i] = [lefti,
righti]` describes the `ith` interval starting at `lefti` and ending at
`righti` **(inclusive)**. The **size** of an interval is defined as the number
of integers it contains, or more formally `righti - lefti + 1`.

You are also given an integer array `queries`. The answer to the `jth` query
is the **size of the smallest interval** `i` such that `lefti <= queries[j] <=
righti`. If no such interval exists, the answer is `-1`.

Return _an array containing the answers to the queries_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** intervals = [[1,4],[2,4],[3,6],[4,4]], queries = [2,3,4,5]
    **Output:** [3,3,1,4]
    **Explanation:** The queries are processed as follows:
    - Query = 2: The interval [2,4] is the smallest interval containing 2. The answer is 4 - 2 + 1 = 3.
    - Query = 3: The interval [2,4] is the smallest interval containing 3. The answer is 4 - 2 + 1 = 3.
    - Query = 4: The interval [4,4] is the smallest interval containing 4. The answer is 4 - 4 + 1 = 1.
    - Query = 5: The interval [3,6] is the smallest interval containing 5. The answer is 6 - 3 + 1 = 4.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** intervals = [[2,3],[2,5],[1,8],[20,25]], queries = [2,19,5,22]
    **Output:** [2,-1,4,6]
    **Explanation:** The queries are processed as follows:
    - Query = 2: The interval [2,3] is the smallest interval containing 2. The answer is 3 - 2 + 1 = 2.
    - Query = 19: None of the intervals contain 19. The answer is -1.
    - Query = 5: The interval [2,5] is the smallest interval containing 5. The answer is 5 - 2 + 1 = 4.
    - Query = 22: The interval [20,25] is the smallest interval containing 22. The answer is 25 - 20 + 1 = 6.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= intervals.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= queries.length <= 105`
  * `intervals[i].length == 2`
  * `1 <= lefti <= righti <= 107`
  * `1 <= queries[j] <= 107`
