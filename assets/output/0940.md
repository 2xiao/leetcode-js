# [940. Distinct Subsequences II](https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences-ii)

## 题目

Given a string s, return _the number of **distinct non-empty subsequences**
of_ `s`. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original
string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the
relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a
subsequence of `" _a_ b _c_ d _e_ "` while `"aec"` is not.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "abc"
    **Output:** 7
    **Explanation:** The 7 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", and "abc".
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "aba"
    **Output:** 6
    **Explanation:** The 6 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "ab", "aa", "ba", and "aba".
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "aaa"
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** The 3 distinct subsequences are "a", "aa" and "aaa".
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 2000`
  * `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
