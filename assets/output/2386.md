# [2386. Find the K-Sum of an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-k-sum-of-an-array)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `nums` and a **positive** integer `k`. You can
choose any **subsequence** of the array and sum all of its elements together.

We define the **K-Sum** of the array as the `kth` **largest** subsequence sum
that can be obtained ( **not** necessarily distinct).

Return _the K-Sum of the array_.

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by
deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining
elements.

**Note** that the empty subsequence is considered to have a sum of `0`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [2,4,-2], k = 5
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: All the possible subsequence sums that we can obtain are the following sorted in decreasing order:
> - 6, 4, 4, 2, _2_ , 0, 0, -2.
> 
> The 5-Sum of the array is 2.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [1,-2,3,4,-10,12], k = 16
> 
> Output: 10
> 
> Explanation: The 16-Sum of the array is 10.

**Constraints:**

  * `n == nums.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 105`
  * `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
  * `1 <= k <= min(2000, 2n)`
