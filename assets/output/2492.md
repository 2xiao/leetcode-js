# [2492. Minimum Score of a Path Between Two Cities](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-score-of-a-path-between-two-cities)

## 题目

You are given a positive integer `n` representing `n` cities numbered from `1`
to `n`. You are also given a **2D** array `roads` where `roads[i] = [ai, bi,
distancei]` indicates that there is a **bidirectional** road between cities
`ai` and `bi` with a distance equal to `distancei`. The cities graph is not
necessarily connected.

The **score** of a path between two cities is defined as the **minimum**
distance of a road in this path.

Return _the **minimum** possible score of a path between cities _`1` _and_`n`.

**Note** :

  * A path is a sequence of roads between two cities.
  * It is allowed for a path to contain the same road **multiple** times, and you can visit cities `1` and `n` multiple times along the path.
  * The test cases are generated such that there is **at least** one path between `1` and `n`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 4, roads = [[1,2,9],[2,3,6],[2,4,5],[1,4,7]]
> 
> Output: 5
> 
> Explanation: The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -> 2 -> 4. The score of this path is min(9,5) = 5.
> 
> It can be shown that no other path has less score.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/12/graph22.png)

> Input: n = 4, roads = [[1,2,2],[1,3,4],[3,4,7]]
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4. The score of this path is min(2,2,4,7) = 2.

**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= n <= 105`
  * `1 <= roads.length <= 105`
  * `roads[i].length == 3`
  * `1 <= ai, bi <= n`
  * `ai != bi`
  * `1 <= distancei <= 104`
  * There are no repeated edges.
  * There is at least one path between `1` and `n`.
