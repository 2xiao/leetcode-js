# [496. Next Greater Element I](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i)

## 题目

The **next greater element** of some element `x` in an array is the **first
greater** element that is **to the right** of `x` in the same array.

You are given two **distinct 0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`,
where `nums1` is a subset of `nums2`.

For each `0 <= i < nums1.length`, find the index `j` such that `nums1[i] ==
nums2[j]` and determine the **next greater element** of `nums2[j]` in `nums2`.
If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is `-1`.

Return _an array_`ans` _of length_`nums1.length` _such that_`ans[i]` _is the
**next greater element** as described above._



**Example 1:**

> Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
> 
> Output: [-1,3,-1]
> 
> Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
> - 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3, _4_ ,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
> - 1 is underlined in nums2 = [ _1_ ,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
> - 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4, _2_ ]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
> 
> Output: [3,-1]
> 
> Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
> - 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1, _2_ ,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
> - 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3, _4_ ]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums1.length <= nums2.length <= 1000`
  * `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 104`
  * All integers in `nums1` and `nums2` are **unique**.
  * All the integers of `nums1` also appear in `nums2`.



**Follow up:** Could you find an `O(nums1.length + nums2.length)` solution?
