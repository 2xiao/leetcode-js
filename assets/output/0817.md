# [817. Linked List Components](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-components/)

## 题目

You are given the `head` of a linked list containing unique integer values and
an integer array `nums` that is a subset of the linked list values.

Return _the number of connected components in_`nums` _where two values are
connected if they appear **consecutively** in the linked list_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: head = [0,1,2,3], nums = [0,1,3]
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: 0 and 1 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3] are the two connected components.

**Example 2:**

> Input: head = [0,1,2,3,4], nums = [0,3,1,4]
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: 0 and 1 are connected, 3 and 4 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3, 4] are the two connected components.

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the linked list is `n`.
- `1 <= n <= 10^4`
- `0 <= Node.val < n`
- All the values `Node.val` are **unique**.
- `1 <= nums.length <= n`
- `0 <= nums[i] < n`
- All the values of `nums` are **unique**.
