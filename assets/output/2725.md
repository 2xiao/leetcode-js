# [2725. Interval Cancellation](https://leetcode.com/problems/interval-cancellation/)

## 题目

Given a function `fn`, an array of arguments `args`, and an interval time `t`,
return a cancel function `cancelFn`.

The function `fn` should be called with `args` immediately and then called
again every `t` milliseconds until `cancelFn` is called at `cancelT` ms.



**Example 1:**

> Input: fn = (x) => x * 2, args = [4], t = 35, cancelT = 190
> 
> Output: 
> 
> [
> 
>    {"time": 0, "returned": 8},
> 
>    {"time": 35, "returned": 8},
> 
>    {"time": 70, "returned": 8},
> 
>    {"time": 105, "returned": 8},
> 
>    {"time": 140, "returned": 8},
> 
>    {"time": 175, "returned": 8}
> 
> ]
> 
> Explanation: 
> 
> const result = []
> 
> const fn = (x) => x * 2
> 
> const args = [4], t = 35, cancelT = 190
> 
> 
> 
> const start = performance.now()
> 
> 
> 
> const log = (...argsArr) => {
> 
> > 
> const diff = Math.floor(performance.now() - start)
> 
> > 
> result.push({"time": diff, "returned": fn(...argsArr)})
> 
> }
> 
> 
> 
> const cancel = cancellable(log, [4], 35);
> 
> setTimeout(cancel, 190);
> 
> 
> 
> setTimeout(() => {
> 
> > 
> console.log(result) // Output
> 
>  }, cancelT + t + 15)  
> 
> 
> 
> Every 35ms, fn(4) is called. Until t=190ms, then it is cancelled.
> 
> 1st fn call is at 0ms. fn(4) returns 8.
> 
> 2nd fn call is at 35ms. fn(4) returns 8.
> 
> 3rd fn call is at 70ms. fn(4) returns 8.
> 
> 4th fn call is at 105ms. fn(4) returns 8.
> 
> 5th fn call is at 140ms. fn(4) returns 8.
> 
> 6th fn call is at 175ms. fn(4) returns 8.
> 
> Cancelled at 190ms

**Example 2:**

> Input: fn = (x1, x2) => (x1 * x2), args = [2, 5], t = 30, cancelT = 165
> 
> Output: 
> 
> [
> 
>    {"time": 0, "returned": 10},
> 
>    {"time": 30, "returned": 10},
> 
>    {"time": 60, "returned": 10},
> 
>    {"time": 90, "returned": 10},
> 
>    {"time": 120, "returned": 10},
> 
>    {"time": 150, "returned": 10}
> 
> ]
> 
> Explanation: Every 30ms, fn(2, 5) is called. Until t=165ms, then it is cancelled.
> 
> 1st fn call is at 0ms 
> 
> 2nd fn call is at 30ms 
> 
> 3rd fn call is at 60ms 
> 
> 4th fn call is at 90ms 
> 
> 5th fn call is at 120ms 
> 
> 6th fn call is at 150ms
> 
> Cancelled at 165ms

**Example 3:**

> Input: fn = (x1, x2, x3) => (x1 + x2 + x3), args = [5, 1, 3], t = 50, cancelT = 180
> 
> Output: 
> 
> [
> 
>    {"time": 0, "returned": 9},
> 
>    {"time": 50, "returned": 9},
> 
>    {"time": 100, "returned": 9},
> 
>    {"time": 150, "returned": 9}
> 
> ]
> 
> Explanation: Every 50ms, fn(5, 1, 3) is called. Until t=180ms, then it is cancelled. 
> 
> 1st fn call is at 0ms
> 
> 2nd fn call is at 50ms
> 
> 3rd fn call is at 100ms
> 
> 4th fn call is at 150ms
> 
> Cancelled at 180ms

**Constraints:**

  * `fn` is a function
  * `args` is a valid JSON array
  * `1 <= args.length <= 10`
  * `30 <= t <= 100`
  * `10 <= cancelT <= 500`
