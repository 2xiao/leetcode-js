# [2280. Minimum Lines to Represent a Line Chart](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-lines-to-represent-a-line-chart/)

## 题目

You are given a 2D integer array `stockPrices` where `stockPrices[i] = [dayi,
pricei]` indicates the price of the stock on day `dayi` is `pricei`. A **line
chart** is created from the array by plotting the points on an XY plane with
the X-axis representing the day and the Y-axis representing the price and
connecting adjacent points. One such example is shown below:

Return _the **minimum number of lines** needed to represent the line chart_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: stockPrices = [[1,7],[2,6],[3,5],[4,4],[5,4],[6,3],[7,2],[8,1]]
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> The diagram above represents the input, with the X-axis representing the day and Y-axis representing the price.
> 
> The following 3 lines can be drawn to represent the line chart:
> - Line 1 (in red) from (1,7) to (4,4) passing through (1,7), (2,6), (3,5), and (4,4).
> - Line 2 (in blue) from (4,4) to (5,4).
> - Line 3 (in green) from (5,4) to (8,1) passing through (5,4), (6,3), (7,2), and (8,1).
> 
> It can be shown that it is not possible to represent the line chart using less than 3 lines.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/30/ex1.png)

> Input: stockPrices = [[3,4],[1,2],[7,8],[2,3]]
> 
> Output: 1
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> As shown in the diagram above, the line chart can be represented with a single line.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= stockPrices.length <= 105`
  * `stockPrices[i].length == 2`
  * `1 <= dayi, pricei <= 109`
  * All `dayi` are **distinct**.
