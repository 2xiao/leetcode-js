# [2817. Minimum Absolute Difference Between Elements With Constraint](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-between-elements-with-constraint)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `x`.

Find the **minimum absolute difference** between two elements in the array
that are at least `x` indices apart.

In other words, find two indices `i` and `j` such that `abs(i - j) >= x` and
`abs(nums[i] - nums[j])` is minimized.

Return _an integer denoting the **minimum** absolute difference between two
elements that are at least_ `x` _indices apart_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [4,3,2,4], x = 2
    **Output:** 0
    **Explanation:** We can select nums[0] = 4 and nums[3] = 4. 
    They are at least 2 indices apart, and their absolute difference is the minimum, 0. 
    It can be shown that 0 is the optimal answer.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [5,3,2,10,15], x = 1
    **Output:** 1
    **Explanation:** We can select nums[1] = 3 and nums[2] = 2.
    They are at least 1 index apart, and their absolute difference is the minimum, 1.
    It can be shown that 1 is the optimal answer.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4], x = 3
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** We can select nums[0] = 1 and nums[3] = 4.
    They are at least 3 indices apart, and their absolute difference is the minimum, 3.
    It can be shown that 3 is the optimal answer.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`
  * `0 <= x < nums.length`
