# [2516. Take K of Each Character From Left and Right](https://leetcode.com/problems/take-k-of-each-character-from-left-and-right/)

## 题目

You are given a string `s` consisting of the characters `'a'`, `'b'`, and
`'c'` and a non-negative integer `k`. Each minute, you may take either the
**leftmost** character of `s`, or the **rightmost** character of `s`.

Return _the **minimum** number of minutes needed for you to take **at least**
_`k` _of each character, or return_`-1` _if it is not possible to take_`k` _of
each character._

**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "aabaaaacaabc", k = 2
>
> Output: 8
>
> Explanation:
>
> Take three characters from the left of s. You now have two 'a' characters, and one 'b' character.
>
> Take five characters from the right of s. You now have four 'a' characters, two 'b' characters, and two 'c' characters.
>
> A total of 3 + 5 = 8 minutes is needed.
>
> It can be proven that 8 is the minimum number of minutes needed.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "a", k = 1
>
> Output: -1
>
> Explanation: It is not possible to take one 'b' or 'c' so return -1.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists of only the letters `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`.
- `0 <= k <= s.length`
