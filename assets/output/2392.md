# [2392. Build a Matrix With Conditions](https://leetcode.com/problems/build-a-matrix-with-conditions)

## 题目

You are given a **positive** integer `k`. You are also given:

  * a 2D integer array `rowConditions` of size `n` where `rowConditions[i] = [abovei, belowi]`, and
  * a 2D integer array `colConditions` of size `m` where `colConditions[i] = [lefti, righti]`.

The two arrays contain integers from `1` to `k`.

You have to build a `k x k` matrix that contains each of the numbers from `1`
to `k` **exactly once**. The remaining cells should have the value `0`.

The matrix should also satisfy the following conditions:

  * The number `abovei` should appear in a **row** that is strictly **above** the row at which the number `belowi` appears for all `i` from `0` to `n - 1`.
  * The number `lefti` should appear in a **column** that is strictly **left** of the column at which the number `righti` appears for all `i` from `0` to `m - 1`.

Return _**any** matrix that satisfies the conditions_. If no answer exists,
return an empty matrix.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/07/06/gridosdrawio.png)

    
    
    **Input:** k = 3, rowConditions = [[1,2],[3,2]], colConditions = [[2,1],[3,2]]
    **Output:** [[3,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,2,0]]
    **Explanation:** The diagram above shows a valid example of a matrix that satisfies all the conditions.
    The row conditions are the following:
    - Number 1 is in row _1_ , and number 2 is in row _2_ , so 1 is above 2 in the matrix.
    - Number 3 is in row _0_ , and number 2 is in row _2_ , so 3 is above 2 in the matrix.
    The column conditions are the following:
    - Number 2 is in column _1_ , and number 1 is in column _2_ , so 2 is left of 1 in the matrix.
    - Number 3 is in column _0_ , and number 2 is in column _1_ , so 3 is left of 2 in the matrix.
    Note that there may be multiple correct answers.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** k = 3, rowConditions = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1],[2,3]], colConditions = [[2,1]]
    **Output:** []
    **Explanation:** From the first two conditions, 3 has to be below 1 but the third conditions needs 3 to be above 1 to be satisfied.
    No matrix can satisfy all the conditions, so we return the empty matrix.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= k <= 400`
  * `1 <= rowConditions.length, colConditions.length <= 104`
  * `rowConditions[i].length == colConditions[i].length == 2`
  * `1 <= abovei, belowi, lefti, righti <= k`
  * `abovei != belowi`
  * `lefti != righti`
