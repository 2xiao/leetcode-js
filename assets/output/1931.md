# [1931. Painting a Grid With Three Different Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/painting-a-grid-with-three-different-colors)

## 题目

You are given two integers `m` and `n`. Consider an `m x n` grid where each
cell is initially white. You can paint each cell **red** , **green** , or
**blue**. All cells **must** be painted.

Return _the number of ways to color the grid with **no two adjacent cells
having the same color**_. Since the answer can be very large, return it
**modulo** `109 + 7`.
