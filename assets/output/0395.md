# [395. Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-least-k-repeating-characters)

## 题目

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return _the length of the longest
substring of_ `s` _such that the frequency of each character in this substring
is greater than or equal to_ `k`.

if no such substring exists, return 0.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "aaabb", k = 3
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "ababbc", k = 2
    **Output:** 5
    **Explanation:** The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 104`
  * `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
  * `1 <= k <= 105`
