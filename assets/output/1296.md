# [1296. Divide Array in Sets of K Consecutive Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-array-in-sets-of-k-consecutive-numbers/)

## 题目

Given an array of integers `nums` and a positive integer `k`, check whether it
is possible to divide this array into sets of `k` consecutive numbers.

Return `true` _if it is possible_. \*\*\*\* Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,6], k = 4
>
> Output: true
>
> Explanation: Array can be divided into [1,2,3,4] and [3,4,5,6].

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [3,2,1,2,3,4,3,4,5,9,10,11], k = 3
>
> Output: true
>
> Explanation: Array can be divided into [1,2,3] , [2,3,4] , [3,4,5] and [9,10,11].

**Example 3:**

> Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 3
>
> Output: false
>
> Explanation: Each array should be divided in subarrays of size 3.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

**Note:** This question is the same as 846:
