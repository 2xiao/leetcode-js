# [2223. Sum of Scores of Built Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-scores-of-built-strings)

## 题目

You are **building** a string `s` of length `n` **one** character at a time,
**prepending** each new character to the **front** of the string. The strings
are labeled from `1` to `n`, where the string with length `i` is labeled `si`.

  * For example, for `s = "abaca"`, `s1 == "a"`, `s2 == "ca"`, `s3 == "aca"`, etc.

The **score** of `si` is the length of the **longest common prefix** between
`si` and `sn` (Note that `s == sn`).

Given the final string `s`, return _the **sum** of the **score** of every
_`si`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "babab"
    **Output:** 9
    **Explanation:**
    For s1 == "b", the longest common prefix is "b" which has a score of 1.
    For s2 == "ab", there is no common prefix so the score is 0.
    For s3 == "bab", the longest common prefix is "bab" which has a score of 3.
    For s4 == "abab", there is no common prefix so the score is 0.
    For s5 == "babab", the longest common prefix is "babab" which has a score of 5.
    The sum of the scores is 1 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 5 = 9, so we return 9.

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "azbazbzaz"
    **Output:** 14
    **Explanation:** 
    For s2 == "az", the longest common prefix is "az" which has a score of 2.
    For s6 == "azbzaz", the longest common prefix is "azb" which has a score of 3.
    For s9 == "azbazbzaz", the longest common prefix is "azbazbzaz" which has a score of 9.
    For all other si, the score is 0.
    The sum of the scores is 2 + 3 + 9 = 14, so we return 14.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
