# [3203. Find Minimum Diameter After Merging Two Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-diameter-after-merging-two-trees/)

## 题目

There exist two **undirected** trees with `n` and `m` nodes, numbered from `0`
to `n - 1` and from `0` to `m - 1`, respectively. You are given two 2D integer
arrays `edges1` and `edges2` of lengths `n - 1` and `m - 1`, respectively,
where `edges1[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes
`ai` and `bi` in the first tree and `edges2[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates that
there is an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi` in the second tree.

You must connect one node from the first tree with another node from the
second tree with an edge.

Return the **minimum** possible **diameter** of the resulting tree.

The **diameter** of a tree is the length of the _longest_ path between any two
nodes in the tree.

**Example
1:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/04/22/example11-transformed.png)

**Input:** edges1 = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]], edges2 = [[0,1]]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

We can obtain a tree of diameter 3 by connecting node 0 from the first tree
with any node from the second tree.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** edges1 = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[2,4],[2,5],[3,6],[2,7]], edges2 =
[[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[2,4],[2,5],[3,6],[2,7]]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:**

We can obtain a tree of diameter 5 by connecting node 0 from the first tree
with node 0 from the second tree.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n, m <= 10^5`
- `edges1.length == n - 1`
- `edges2.length == m - 1`
- `edges1[i].length == edges2[i].length == 2`
- `edges1[i] = [ai, bi]`
- `0 <= ai, bi < n`
- `edges2[i] = [ui, vi]`
- `0 <= ui, vi < m`
- The input is generated such that `edges1` and `edges2` represent valid trees.
