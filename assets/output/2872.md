# [2872. Maximum Number of K-Divisible Components](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-k-divisible-components/)

## 题目

There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You
are given the integer `n` and a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`,
where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai`
and `bi` in the tree.

You are also given a **0-indexed** integer array `values` of length `n`, where
`values[i]` is the **value** associated with the `ith` node, and an integer
`k`.

A **valid split** of the tree is obtained by removing any set of edges,
possibly empty, from the tree such that the resulting components all have
values that are divisible by `k`, where the **value of a connected component**
is the sum of the values of its nodes.

Return _the **maximum number of components** in any valid split_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,2],[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]], values = [1,8,1,4,4], k = 6
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: We remove the edge connecting node 1 with 2. The resulting split is valid because:
> - The value of the component containing nodes 1 and 3 is values[1] + values[3] = 12.
> - The value of the component containing nodes 0, 2, and 4 is values[0] + values[2] + values[4] = 6.
> 
> It can be shown that no other valid split has more than 2 connected components.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/08/07/example21svg-1.jpg)

> Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6]], values = [3,0,6,1,5,2,1], k = 3
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation: We remove the edge connecting node 0 with 2, and the edge connecting node 0 with 1. The resulting split is valid because:
> - The value of the component containing node 0 is values[0] = 3.
> - The value of the component containing nodes 2, 5, and 6 is values[2] + values[5] + values[6] = 9.
> - The value of the component containing nodes 1, 3, and 4 is values[1] + values[3] + values[4] = 6.
> 
> It can be shown that no other valid split has more than 3 connected components.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 3 * 104`
  * `edges.length == n - 1`
  * `edges[i].length == 2`
  * `0 <= ai, bi < n`
  * `values.length == n`
  * `0 <= values[i] <= 109`
  * `1 <= k <= 109`
  * Sum of `values` is divisible by `k`.
  * The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.
