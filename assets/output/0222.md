# [222. Count Complete Tree Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes)

## 题目

Given the `root` of a **complete** binary tree, return the number of the nodes
in the tree.

According to
**[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees)**
, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete
binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It
can have between `1` and `2h` nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than `O(n)` time complexity.



**Example 1:**

> Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
> 
> Output: 6

**Example 2:**

> Input: root = []
> 
> Output: 0

**Example 3:**

> Input: root = [1]
> 
> Output: 1

**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5 * 104]`.
  * `0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 104`
  * The tree is guaranteed to be **complete**.
