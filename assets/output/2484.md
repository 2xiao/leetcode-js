# [2484. Count Palindromic Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-palindromic-subsequences/)

## 题目

Given a string of digits `s`, return _the number of **palindromic
subsequences** of_ `s` _having length_`5`. Since the answer may be very large,
return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Note:**

- A string is **palindromic** if it reads the same forward and backward.
- A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "103301"
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation:
>
> There are 6 possible subsequences of length 5: "10330","10331","10301","10301","13301","03301".
>
> Two of them (both equal to "10301") are palindromic.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "0000000"
>
> Output: 21
>
> Explanation: All 21 subsequences are "00000", which is palindromic.

**Example 3:**

> Input: s = "9999900000"
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: The only two palindromic subsequences are "99999" and "00000".

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
- `s` consists of digits.
