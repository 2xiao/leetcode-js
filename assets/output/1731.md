For this problem, we will consider a **manager** an employee who has at least
1 other employee reporting to them.

Write a solution to report the ids and the names of all **managers** , the
number of employees who report **directly** to them, and the average age of
the reports rounded to the nearest integer.

Return the result table ordered by `employee_id`.

The result format is in the following example.



**Example 1:**

> Input: 
> 
> Employees table:
> 
> +-------------+---------+------------+-----+
> 
> | employee_id | name> 
> | reports_to | age |
> 
> +-------------+---------+------------+-----+
> 
> | 9> 
> > 
>    | Hercy   | null> 
>    | 43  |
> 
> | 6> 
> > 
>    | Alice   | 9> 
> > 
>   | 41  |
> 
> | 4> 
> > 
>    | Bob> 
>  | 9> 
> > 
>   | 36  |
> 
> | 2> 
> > 
>    | Winston | null> 
>    | 37  |
> 
> +-------------+---------+------------+-----+
> 
> Output: 
> 
> +-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+
> 
> | employee_id | name  | reports_count | average_age |
> 
> +-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+

>  | 39> 
> > 
>   |
> 
> +-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+
> 
> Explanation: Hercy has 2 people report directly to him, Alice and Bob. Their average age is (41+36)/2 = 38.5, which is 39 after rounding it to the nearest integer.
