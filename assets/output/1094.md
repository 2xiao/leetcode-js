# [1094. Car Pooling](https://leetcode.com/problems/car-pooling/)

## 题目

There is a car with `capacity` empty seats. The vehicle only drives east
(i.e., it cannot turn around and drive west).

You are given the integer `capacity` and an array `trips` where `trips[i] =
[numPassengersi, fromi, toi]` indicates that the `ith` trip has
`numPassengersi` passengers and the locations to pick them up and drop them
off are `fromi` and `toi` respectively. The locations are given as the number
of kilometers due east from the car's initial location.

Return `true` _if it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for
all the given trips, or_`false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 4
>
> Output: false

**Example 2:**

> Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 5
>
> Output: true

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= trips.length <= 1000`
- `trips[i].length == 3`
- `1 <= numPassengersi <= 100`
- `0 <= fromi < toi <= 1000`
- `1 <= capacity <= 10^5`
