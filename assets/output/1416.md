# [1416. Restore The Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/restore-the-array)

## 题目

A program was supposed to print an array of integers. The program forgot to
print whitespaces and the array is printed as a string of digits `s` and all
we know is that all integers in the array were in the range `[1, k]` and there
are no leading zeros in the array.

Given the string `s` and the integer `k`, return _the number of the possible
arrays that can be printed as_`s` _using the mentioned program_. Since the
answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "1000", k = 10000
    **Output:** 1
    **Explanation:** The only possible array is [1000]
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "1000", k = 10
    **Output:** 0
    **Explanation:** There cannot be an array that was printed this way and has all integer >= 1 and <= 10.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "1317", k = 2000
    **Output:** 8
    **Explanation:** Possible arrays are [1317],[131,7],[13,17],[1,317],[13,1,7],[1,31,7],[1,3,17],[1,3,1,7]
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `s` consists of only digits and does not contain leading zeros.
  * `1 <= k <= 109`
