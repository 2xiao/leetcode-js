# [2859. Sum of Values at Indices With K Set Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-values-at-indices-with-k-set-bits)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

Return _an integer that denotes the **sum** of elements in _`nums` _whose
corresponding **indices** have **exactly** _`k` _set bits in their binary
representation._

The **set bits** in an integer are the `1`'s present when it is written in
binary.

  * For example, the binary representation of `21` is `10101`, which has `3` set bits.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [5,10,1,5,2], k = 1
    **Output:** 13
    **Explanation:** The binary representation of the indices are: 
    0 = 0002
    1 = 0012
    2 = 0102
    3 = 0112
    4 = 1002 
    Indices 1, 2, and 4 have k = 1 set bits in their binary representation.
    Hence, the answer is nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 13.

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [4,3,2,1], k = 2
    **Output:** 1
    **Explanation:** The binary representation of the indices are:
    0 = 002
    1 = 012
    2 = 102
    3 = 112
    Only index 3 has k = 2 set bits in its binary representation.
    Hence, the answer is nums[3] = 1.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 105`
  * `0 <= k <= 10`
