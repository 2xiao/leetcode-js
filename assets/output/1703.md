# [1703. Minimum Adjacent Swaps for K Consecutive Ones](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-adjacent-swaps-for-k-consecutive-ones)

## 题目

You are given an integer array, `nums`, and an integer `k`. `nums` comprises
of only `0`'s and `1`'s. In one move, you can choose two **adjacent** indices
and swap their values.

Return _the **minimum** number of moves required so that _`nums` _has_`k`
_**consecutive** _`1` _' s_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1], k = 2
> 
> Output: 1
> 
> Explanation: In 1 move, nums could be [1,0,0,0, _1_ , _1_ ] and have 2 consecutive 1's.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1], k = 3
> 
> Output: 5
> 
> Explanation: In 5 moves, the leftmost 1 can be shifted right until nums = [0,0,0,0,0, _1_ , _1_ , _1_ ].

**Example 3:**

> Input: nums = [1,1,0,1], k = 2
> 
> Output: 0
> 
> Explanation: nums already has 2 consecutive 1's.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `nums[i]` is `0` or `1`.
  * `1 <= k <= sum(nums)`
