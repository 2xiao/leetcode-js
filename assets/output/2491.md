# [2491. Divide Players Into Teams of Equal Skill](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-players-into-teams-of-equal-skill/)

## 题目

You are given a positive integer array `skill` of **even** length `n` where
`skill[i]` denotes the skill of the `ith` player. Divide the players into `n /
2` teams of size `2` such that the total skill of each team is **equal**.

The **chemistry** of a team is equal to the **product** of the skills of the
players on that team.

Return _the sum of the **chemistry** of all the teams, or return _`-1` _if
there is no way to divide the players into teams such that the total skill of
each team is equal._

**Example 1:**

> Input: skill = [3,2,5,1,3,4]
>
> Output: 22
>
> Explanation:
>
> Divide the players into the following teams: (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), where each team has a total skill of 6.
>
> The sum of the chemistry of all the teams is: 1 _ 5 + 2 _ 4 + 3 \* 3 = 5 + 8 + 9 = 22.

**Example 2:**

> Input: skill = [3,4]
>
> Output: 12
>
> Explanation:
>
> The two players form a team with a total skill of 7.
>
> The chemistry of the team is 3 \* 4 = 12.

**Example 3:**

> Input: skill = [1,1,2,3]
>
> Output: -1
>
> Explanation:
>
> There is no way to divide the players into teams such that the total skill of each team is equal.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= skill.length <= 10^5`
- `skill.length` is even.
- `1 <= skill[i] <= 1000`
