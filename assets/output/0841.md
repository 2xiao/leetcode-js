# [841. Keys and Rooms](https://leetcode.com/problems/keys-and-rooms)

## 题目

There are `n` rooms labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and all the rooms are locked
except for room `0`. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot
enter a locked room without having its key.

When you visit a room, you may find a set of **distinct keys** in it. Each key
has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of
them with you to unlock the other rooms.

Given an array `rooms` where `rooms[i]` is the set of keys that you can obtain
if you visited room `i`, return `true` _if you can visit **all** the rooms,
or_ `false` _otherwise_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]
    **Output:** true
    **Explanation:** 
    We visit room 0 and pick up key 1.
    We then visit room 1 and pick up key 2.
    We then visit room 2 and pick up key 3.
    We then visit room 3.
    Since we were able to visit every room, we return true.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]
    **Output:** false
    **Explanation:** We can not enter room number 2 since the only key that unlocks it is in that room.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `n == rooms.length`
  * `2 <= n <= 1000`
  * `0 <= rooms[i].length <= 1000`
  * `1 <= sum(rooms[i].length) <= 3000`
  * `0 <= rooms[i][j] < n`
  * All the values of `rooms[i]` are **unique**.
