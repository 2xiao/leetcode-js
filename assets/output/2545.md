# [2545. Sort the Students by Their Kth Score](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-the-students-by-their-kth-score/)

## 题目

There is a class with `m` students and `n` exams. You are given a
**0-indexed** `m x n` integer matrix `score`, where each row represents one
student and `score[i][j]` denotes the score the `ith` student got in the `jth`
exam. The matrix `score` contains **distinct** integers only.

You are also given an integer `k`. Sort the students (i.e., the rows of the
matrix) by their scores in the `kth` ( **0-indexed** ) exam from the highest
to the lowest.

Return _the matrix after sorting it._



**Example 1:**

> Input: score = [[10,6,9,1],[7,5,11,2],[4,8,3,15]], k = 2
> 
> Output: [[7,5,11,2],[10,6,9,1],[4,8,3,15]]
> 
> Explanation: In the above diagram, S denotes the student, while E denotes the exam.
> - The student with index 1 scored 11 in exam 2, which is the highest score, so they got first place.
> - The student with index 0 scored 9 in exam 2, which is the second highest score, so they got second place.
> - The student with index 2 scored 3 in exam 2, which is the lowest score, so they got third place.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/11/30/example2.png)

> Input: score = [[3,4],[5,6]], k = 0
> 
> Output: [[5,6],[3,4]]
> 
> Explanation: In the above diagram, S denotes the student, while E denotes the exam.
> - The student with index 1 scored 5 in exam 0, which is the highest score, so they got first place.
> - The student with index 0 scored 3 in exam 0, which is the lowest score, so they got second place.

**Constraints:**

  * `m == score.length`
  * `n == score[i].length`
  * `1 <= m, n <= 250`
  * `1 <= score[i][j] <= 105`
  * `score` consists of **distinct** integers.
  * `0 <= k < n`
