# [1383. Maximum Performance of a Team](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-performance-of-a-team)

## 题目

You are given two integers `n` and `k` and two integer arrays `speed` and
`efficiency` both of length `n`. There are `n` engineers numbered from `1` to
`n`. `speed[i]` and `efficiency[i]` represent the speed and efficiency of the
`ith` engineer respectively.

Choose **at most** `k` different engineers out of the `n` engineers to form a
team with the maximum **performance**.

The performance of a team is the sum of its engineers' speeds multiplied by
the minimum efficiency among its engineers.

Return _the maximum performance of this team_. Since the answer can be a huge
number, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 2
> 
> Output: 60
> 
> Explanation: 
> 
> We have the maximum performance of the team by selecting engineer 2 (with speed=10 and efficiency=4) and engineer 5 (with speed=5 and efficiency=7). That is, performance = (10 + 5) * min(4, 7) = 60.

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 3
> 
> Output: 68
> 
> Explanation: This is the same example as the first but k = 3. We can select engineer 1, engineer 2 and engineer 5 to get the maximum performance of the team. That is, performance = (2 + 10 + 5) * min(5, 4, 7) = 68.

**Example 3:**

> Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 4
> 
> Output: 72

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= k <= n <= 105`
  * `speed.length == n`
  * `efficiency.length == n`
  * `1 <= speed[i] <= 105`
  * `1 <= efficiency[i] <= 108`
