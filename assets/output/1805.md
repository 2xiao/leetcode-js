# [1805. Number of Different Integers in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-different-integers-in-a-string)

## 题目

You are given a string `word` that consists of digits and lowercase English
letters.

You will replace every non-digit character with a space. For example,
`"a123bc34d8ef34"` will become `" 123  34 8  34"`. Notice that you are left
with some integers that are separated by at least one space: `"123"`, `"34"`,
`"8"`, and `"34"`.

Return _the number of **different** integers after performing the replacement
operations on _`word`.

Two integers are considered different if their decimal representations
**without any leading zeros** are different.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** word = "a _123_ bc _34_ d _8_ ef _34_ "
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** The three different integers are "123", "34", and "8". Notice that "34" is only counted once.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** word = "leet _1234_ code _234_ "
    **Output:** 2
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** word = "a _1_ b _01_ c _001_ "
    **Output:** 1
    **Explanation:** The three integers "1", "01", and "001" all represent the same integer because
    the leading zeros are ignored when comparing their decimal values.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= word.length <= 1000`
  * `word` consists of digits and lowercase English letters.
