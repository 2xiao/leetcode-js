# [1392. Longest Happy Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-happy-prefix)

## 题目

A string is called a **happy prefix** if is a **non-empty** prefix which is
also a suffix (excluding itself).

Given a string `s`, return _the **longest happy prefix** of_ `s`. Return an
empty string `""` if no such prefix exists.



**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "level"
> 
> Output: "l"
> 
> Explanation: s contains 4 prefix excluding itself ("l", "le", "lev", "leve"), and suffix ("l", "el", "vel", "evel"). The largest prefix which is also suffix is given by "l".

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "ababab"
> 
> Output: "abab"
> 
> Explanation: "abab" is the largest prefix which is also suffix. They can overlap in the original string.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
