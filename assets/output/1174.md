## 题目

Table: `Delivery`

    
    
    +-----------------------------+---------+
    | Column Name                 | Type    |
    +-----------------------------+---------+
    | delivery_id                 | int     |
    | customer_id                 | int     |
    | order_date                  | date    |
    | customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |
    +-----------------------------+---------+
    delivery_id is the column of unique values of this table.
    The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).
    



If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then
the order is called **immediate;** otherwise, it is called **scheduled**.

The **first order** of a customer is the order with the earliest order date
that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one
first order.

Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first
orders of all customers, **rounded to 2 decimal places**.

The result format is in the following example.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** 
    Delivery table:
    +-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
    | delivery_id | customer_id | order_date | customer_pref_delivery_date |
    +-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
    | 1           | 1           | 2019-08-01 | 2019-08-02                  |
    | 2           | 2           | 2019-08-02 | 2019-08-02                  |
    | 3           | 1           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-12                  |
    | 4           | 3           | 2019-08-24 | 2019-08-24                  |
    | 5           | 3           | 2019-08-21 | 2019-08-22                  |
    | 6           | 2           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-13                  |
    | 7           | 4           | 2019-08-09 | 2019-08-09                  |
    +-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
    **Output:** 
    +----------------------+
    | immediate_percentage |
    +----------------------+
    | 50.00                |
    +----------------------+
    **Explanation:** 
    The customer id 1 has a first order with delivery id 1 and it is scheduled.
    The customer id 2 has a first order with delivery id 2 and it is immediate.
    The customer id 3 has a first order with delivery id 5 and it is scheduled.
    The customer id 4 has a first order with delivery id 7 and it is immediate.
    Hence, half the customers have immediate first orders.
