# [2608. Shortest Cycle in a Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-cycle-in-a-graph/)

## 题目

There is a **bi-directional** graph with `n` vertices, where each vertex is
labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. The edges in the graph are represented by a given
2D integer array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` denotes an edge between
vertex `ui` and vertex `vi`. Every vertex pair is connected by at most one
edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself.

Return _the length of the **shortest** cycle in the graph_. If no cycle
exists, return `-1`.

A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node, and each edge in the
path is used only once.

**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[3,4],[4,5],[5,6],[6,3]]
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: The cycle with the smallest length is : 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]]
>
> Output: -1
>
> Explanation: There are no cycles in this graph.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 1000`
- `1 <= edges.length <= 1000`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ui, vi < n`
- `ui != vi`
- There are no repeated edges.
