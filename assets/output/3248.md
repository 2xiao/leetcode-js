# [3248. Snake in Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/snake-in-matrix/)

## 题目

There is a snake in an `n x n` matrix `grid` and can move in **four possible
directions**. Each cell in the `grid` is identified by the position:
`grid[i][j] = (i * n) + j`.

The snake starts at cell 0 and follows a sequence of commands.

You are given an integer `n` representing the size of the `grid` and an array
of strings `commands` where each `command[i]` is either `"UP"`, `"RIGHT"`,
`"DOWN"`, and `"LEFT"`. It's guaranteed that the snake will remain within the
`grid` boundaries throughout its movement.

Return the position of the final cell where the snake ends up after executing
`commands`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2, commands = ["RIGHT","DOWN"]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

| 0   | 1   |
| --- | --- |
| 2   | 3   |
| 0   | 1   |
| --- | --- |
| 2   | 3   |
| 0   | 1   |
| --- | --- |
| 2   | 3   |

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3, commands = ["DOWN","RIGHT","UP"]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

| 0   | 1   | 2   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3   | 4   | 5   |
| 6   | 7   | 8   |
| 0   | 1   | 2   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3   | 4   | 5   |
| 6   | 7   | 8   |
| 0   | 1   | 2   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3   | 4   | 5   |
| 6   | 7   | 8   |
| 0   | 1   | 2   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3   | 4   | 5   |
| 6   | 7   | 8   |

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 10`
- `1 <= commands.length <= 100`
- `commands` consists only of `"UP"`, `"RIGHT"`, `"DOWN"`, and `"LEFT"`.
- The input is generated such the snake will not move outside of the boundaries.
