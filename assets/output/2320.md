# [2320. Count Number of Ways to Place Houses](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-ways-to-place-houses)

## 题目

There is a street with `n * 2` **plots** , where there are `n` plots on each
side of the street. The plots on each side are numbered from `1` to `n`. On
each plot, a house can be placed.

Return _the number of ways houses can be placed such that no two houses are
adjacent to each other on the same side of the street_. Since the answer may
be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

Note that if a house is placed on the `ith` plot on one side of the street, a
house can also be placed on the `ith` plot on the other side of the street.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 1
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** 
    Possible arrangements:
    1. All plots are empty.

    3. A house is placed on the other side of the street.
    4. Two houses are placed, one on each side of the street.
