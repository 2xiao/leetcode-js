# [1496. Path Crossing](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-crossing/)

## 题目

Given a string `path`, where `path[i] = 'N'`, `'S'`, `'E'` or `'W'`, each
representing moving one unit north, south, east, or west, respectively. You
start at the origin `(0, 0)` on a 2D plane and walk on the path specified by
`path`.

Return `true` _if the path crosses itself at any point, that is, if at any
time you are on a location you have previously visited_. Return `false`
otherwise.

**Example 1:**

> Input: path = "NES"
>
> Output: false
>
> Explanation: Notice that the path doesn't cross any point more than once.

**Example 2:**

> Input: path = "NESWW"
>
> Output: true
>
> Explanation: Notice that the path visits the origin twice.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= path.length <= 10^4`
- `path[i]` is either `'N'`, `'S'`, `'E'`, or `'W'`.
