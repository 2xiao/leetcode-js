# [1971. Find if Path Exists in Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-if-path-exists-in-graph)

## 题目

There is a **bi-directional** graph with `n` vertices, where each vertex is
labeled from `0` to `n - 1` ( **inclusive** ). The edges in the graph are
represented as a 2D integer array `edges`, where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi]`
denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex `ui` and vertex `vi`. Every
vertex pair is connected by **at most one** edge, and no vertex has an edge to
itself.

You want to determine if there is a **valid path** that exists from vertex
`source` to vertex `destination`.

Given `edges` and the integers `n`, `source`, and `destination`, return `true`
_if there is a **valid path** from _`source` _to_`destination` _, or_`false`
_otherwise_ _._



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/14/validpath-ex1.png)

> Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0]], source = 0, destination = 2
> 
> Output: true
> 
> Explanation: There are two paths from vertex 0 to vertex 2:
> - 0 -> 1 -> 2
> - 0 -> 2

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/14/validpath-ex2.png)

> Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[3,5],[5,4],[4,3]], source = 0, destination = 5
> 
> Output: false
> 
> Explanation: There is no path from vertex 0 to vertex 5.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 2 * 105`
  * `0 <= edges.length <= 2 * 105`
  * `edges[i].length == 2`
  * `0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1`
  * `ui != vi`
  * `0 <= source, destination <= n - 1`
  * There are no duplicate edges.
  * There are no self edges.
