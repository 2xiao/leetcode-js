# [2616. Minimize the Maximum Difference of Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-the-maximum-difference-of-pairs/)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `p`. Find
`p` pairs of indices of `nums` such that the **maximum** difference amongst
all the pairs is **minimized**. Also, ensure no index appears more than once
amongst the `p` pairs.

Note that for a pair of elements at the index `i` and `j`, the difference of
this pair is `|nums[i] - nums[j]|`, where `|x|` represents the **absolute**
**value** of `x`.

Return _the **minimum** **maximum** difference among all _`p` _pairs._ We
define the maximum of an empty set to be zero.



**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [10,1,2,7,1,3], p = 2
> 
> Output: 1
> 
> Explanation: The first pair is formed from the indices 1 and 4, and the second pair is formed from the indices 2 and 5. 
> 
> The maximum difference is max(|nums[1] - nums[4]|, |nums[2] - nums[5]|) = max(0, 1) = 1. Therefore, we return 1.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [4,2,1,2], p = 1
> 
> Output: 0
> 
> Explanation: Let the indices 1 and 3 form a pair. The difference of that pair is |2 - 2| = 0, which is the minimum we can attain.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `0 <= nums[i] <= 109`
  * `0 <= p <= (nums.length)/2`
