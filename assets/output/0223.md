# [223. Rectangle Area](https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-area)

## 题目

Given the coordinates of two **rectilinear** rectangles in a 2D plane, return
_the total area covered by the two rectangles_.

The first rectangle is defined by its **bottom-left** corner `(ax1, ay1)` and
its **top-right** corner `(ax2, ay2)`.

The second rectangle is defined by its **bottom-left** corner `(bx1, by1)` and
its **top-right** corner `(bx2, by2)`.



**Example 1:**

plane.png)

    
    
    **Input:** ax1 = -3, ay1 = 0, ax2 = 3, ay2 = 4, bx1 = 0, by1 = -1, bx2 = 9, by2 = 2
    **Output:** 45
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** ax1 = -2, ay1 = -2, ax2 = 2, ay2 = 2, bx1 = -2, by1 = -2, bx2 = 2, by2 = 2
    **Output:** 16
    



**Constraints:**

  * `-104 <= ax1 <= ax2 <= 104`
  * `-104 <= ay1 <= ay2 <= 104`
  * `-104 <= bx1 <= bx2 <= 104`
  * `-104 <= by1 <= by2 <= 104`
