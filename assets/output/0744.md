# [744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-smallest-letter-greater-than-target)

## 题目

You are given an array of characters `letters` that is sorted in **non-
decreasing order** , and a character `target`. There are **at least two
different** characters in `letters`.

Return _the smallest character in_`letters` _that is lexicographically greater
than_`target`. If such a character does not exist, return the first character
in `letters`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
    **Output:** "c"
    **Explanation:** The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"
    **Output:** "f"
    **Explanation:** The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'c' in letters is 'f'.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** letters = ["x","x","y","y"], target = "z"
    **Output:** "x"
    **Explanation:** There are no characters in letters that is lexicographically greater than 'z' so we return letters[0].
    



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= letters.length <= 104`
  * `letters[i]` is a lowercase English letter.
  * `letters` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.
  * `letters` contains at least two different characters.
  * `target` is a lowercase English letter.
