# [2568. Minimum Impossible OR](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-impossible-or/)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`.

We say that an integer x is **expressible** from `nums` if there exist some
integers `0 <= index1 < index2 < ... < indexk < nums.length` for which
`nums[index1] | nums[index2] | ... | nums[indexk] = x`. In other words, an
integer is expressible if it can be written as the bitwise OR of some
subsequence of `nums`.

Return _the minimum **positive non-zero integer** that is not \_\_expressible
from_`nums`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [2,1]
>
> Output: 4
>
> Explanation: 1 and 2 are already present in the array. We know that 3 is expressible, since nums[0] | nums[1] = 2 | 1 = 3. Since 4 is not expressible, we return 4.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [5,3,2]
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation: We can show that 1 is the smallest number that is not expressible.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
