# [2919. Minimum Increment Operations to Make Array Beautiful](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-increment-operations-to-make-array-beautiful/)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` having length `n`, and an
integer `k`.

You can perform the following **increment** operation **any** number of times
( **including zero** ):

- Choose an index `i` in the range `[0, n - 1]`, and increase `nums[i]` by `1`.

An array is considered **beautiful** if, for any **subarray** with a size of
`3` or **more** , its **maximum** element is **greater than or equal** to `k`.

Return _an integer denoting the **minimum** number of increment operations
needed to make _`nums` _**beautiful**._

A subarray is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of elements within an array.

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [2,3,0,0,2], k = 4
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: We can perform the following increment operations to make nums beautiful:
>
> Choose index i = 1 and increase nums[1] by 1 -> [2,4,0,0,2].
>
> Choose index i = 4 and increase nums[4] by 1 -> [2,4,0,0,3].
>
> Choose index i = 4 and increase nums[4] by 1 -> [2,4,0,0,4].
>
> The subarrays with a size of 3 or more are: [2,4,0], [4,0,0], [0,0,4], [2,4,0,0], [4,0,0,4], [2,4,0,0,4].
>
> In all the subarrays, the maximum element is equal to k = 4, so nums is now beautiful.
>
> It can be shown that nums cannot be made beautiful with fewer than 3 increment operations.
>
> Hence, the answer is 3.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [0,1,3,3], k = 5
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: We can perform the following increment operations to make nums beautiful:
>
> Choose index i = 2 and increase nums[2] by 1 -> [0,1,4,3].
>
> Choose index i = 2 and increase nums[2] by 1 -> [0,1,5,3].
>
> The subarrays with a size of 3 or more are: [0,1,5], [1,5,3], [0,1,5,3].
>
> In all the subarrays, the maximum element is equal to k = 5, so nums is now beautiful.
>
> It can be shown that nums cannot be made beautiful with fewer than 2 increment operations.
>
> Hence, the answer is 2.

**Example 3:**

> Input: nums = [1,1,2], k = 1
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation: The only subarray with a size of 3 or more in this example is [1,1,2].
>
> The maximum element, 2, is already greater than k = 1, so we don't need any increment operation.
>
> Hence, the answer is 0.

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= n == nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `0 <= k <= 10^9`
