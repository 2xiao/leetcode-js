# [27. Remove Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/)

## 题目

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of
`val` in `nums` [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm). The order of the elements may be changed. Then return _the number of elements in _ `nums` _which are not equal to_ `val`.

Consider the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val` be `k`,
to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

- Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the elements which are not equal to `val`. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
- Return `k`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
>
> Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
>
> Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
>
> It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
>
> Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
>
> Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
>
> Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
>
> It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 50`
- `0 <= val <= 100`
