# [2398. Maximum Number of Robots Within Budget](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-robots-within-budget/)

## 题目

You have `n` robots. You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays,
`chargeTimes` and `runningCosts`, both of length `n`. The `ith` robot costs
`chargeTimes[i]` units to charge and costs `runningCosts[i]` units to run. You
are also given an integer `budget`.

The **total cost** of running `k` chosen robots is equal to `max(chargeTimes)

- k \* sum(runningCosts)`, where `max(chargeTimes)`is the largest charge cost
among the`k`robots and`sum(runningCosts)`is the sum of running costs among
the`k` robots.

Return _the **maximum** number of **consecutive** robots you can run such that
the total cost **does not** exceed _`budget`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: chargeTimes = [3,6,1,3,4], runningCosts = [2,1,3,4,5], budget = 25
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation:
>
> It is possible to run all individual and consecutive pairs of robots within budget.
>
> To obtain answer 3, consider the first 3 robots. The total cost will be max(3,6,1) + 3 _ sum(2,1,3) = 6 + 3 _ 6 = 24 which is less than 25.
>
> It can be shown that it is not possible to run more than 3 consecutive robots within budget, so we return 3.

**Example 2:**

> Input: chargeTimes = [11,12,19], runningCosts = [10,8,7], budget = 19
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation: No robot can be run that does not exceed the budget, so we return 0.

**Constraints:**

- `chargeTimes.length == runningCosts.length == n`
- `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
- `1 <= chargeTimes[i], runningCosts[i] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= budget <= 1015`
