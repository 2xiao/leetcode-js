# [2179. Count Good Triplets in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-good-triplets-in-an-array/)

## 题目

You are given two **0-indexed** arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of length `n`, both
of which are **permutations** of `[0, 1, ..., n - 1]`.

A **good triplet** is a set of `3` **distinct** values which are present in
**increasing order** by position both in `nums1` and `nums2`. In other words,
if we consider `pos1v` as the index of the value `v` in `nums1` and `pos2v` as
the index of the value `v` in `nums2`, then a good triplet will be a set `(x,
y, z)` where `0 <= x, y, z <= n - 1`, such that `pos1x < pos1y < pos1z` and
`pos2x < pos2y < pos2z`.

Return _the **total number** of good triplets_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums1 = [2,0,1,3], nums2 = [0,1,2,3]
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation:
>
> There are 4 triplets (x,y,z) such that pos1x < pos1y < pos1z. They are (2,0,1), (2,0,3), (2,1,3), and (0,1,3).
>
> Out of those triplets, only the triplet (0,1,3) satisfies pos2x < pos2y < pos2z. Hence, there is only 1 good triplet.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums1 = [4,0,1,3,2], nums2 = [4,1,0,2,3]
>
> Output: 4
>
> Explanation: The 4 good triplets are (4,0,3), (4,0,2), (4,1,3), and (4,1,2).

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums1.length == nums2.length`
- `3 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= n - 1`
- `nums1` and `nums2` are permutations of `[0, 1, ..., n - 1]`.
