# [89. Gray Code](https://leetcode.com/problems/gray-code)

## 题目

An **n-bit gray code sequence** is a sequence of `2n` integers where:

  * Every integer is in the **inclusive** range `[0, 2n - 1]`,
  * The first integer is `0`,
  * An integer appears **no more than once** in the sequence,
  * The binary representation of every pair of **adjacent** integers differs by **exactly one bit** , and
  * The binary representation of the **first** and **last** integers differs by **exactly one bit**.

Given an integer `n`, return _any valid **n-bit gray code sequence**_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 2
    **Output:** [0,1,3,2]
    **Explanation:**
    The binary representation of [0,1,3,2] is [00,01,11,10].
    - 0 _0_ and 0 _1_ differ by one bit
    - _0_ 1 and _1_ 1 differ by one bit
    - 1 _1_ and 1 _0_ differ by one bit
    - _1_ 0 and _0_ 0 differ by one bit
    [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence, whose binary representation is [00,10,11,01].
    - _0_ 0 and _1_ 0 differ by one bit
    - 1 _0_ and 1 _1_ differ by one bit
    - _1_ 1 and _0_ 1 differ by one bit
    - 0 _1_ and 0 _0_ differ by one bit
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 1
    **Output:** [0,1]
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 16`
