# [2328. Number of Increasing Paths in a Grid](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-increasing-paths-in-a-grid/)

## 题目

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`, where you can move from a cell
to any adjacent cell in all `4` directions.

Return \_the number of **strictly** **increasing** paths in the grid such that
you can start from **any** cell and end at **any** cell. \_Since the answer may
be very large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

Two paths are considered different if they do not have exactly the same
sequence of visited cells.

**Example 1:**

> Input: grid = [[1,1],[3,4]]
>
> Output: 8
>
> Explanation: The strictly increasing paths are:
>
> - Paths with length 1: [1], [1], [3], [4].
> - Paths with length 2: [1 -> 3], [1 -> 4], [3 -> 4].
> - Paths with length 3: [1 -> 3 -> 4].
>
> The total number of paths is 4 + 3 + 1 = 8.

**Example 2:**

> Input: grid = [[1],[2]]
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: The strictly increasing paths are:
>
> - Paths with length 1: [1], [2].
> - Paths with length 2: [1 -> 2].
>
> The total number of paths is 2 + 1 = 3.

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 1000`
- `1 <= m * n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^5`
