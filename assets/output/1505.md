# [1505. Minimum Possible Integer After at Most K Adjacent Swaps On Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-possible-integer-after-at-most-k-adjacent-swaps-on-digits/)

## 题目

You are given a string `num` representing **the digits** of a very large
integer and an integer `k`. You are allowed to swap any two adjacent digits of
the integer **at most** `k` times.

Return _the minimum integer you can obtain also as a string_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: num = "4321", k = 4
>
> Output: "1342"
>
> Explanation: The steps to obtain the minimum integer from 4321 with 4 adjacent swaps are shown.

**Example 2:**

> Input: num = "100", k = 1
>
> Output: "010"
>
> Explanation: It's ok for the output to have leading zeros, but the input is guaranteed not to have any leading zeros.

**Example 3:**

> Input: num = "36789", k = 1000
>
> Output: "36789"
>
> Explanation: We can keep the number without any swaps.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= num.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `num` consists of only **digits** and does not contain **leading zeros**.
- `1 <= k <= 10^9`
