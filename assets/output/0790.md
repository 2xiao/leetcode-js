# [790. Domino and Tromino Tiling](https://leetcode.com/problems/domino-and-tromino-tiling/)

## 题目

You have two types of tiles: a `2 x 1` domino shape and a tromino shape. You
may rotate these shapes.

Given an integer n, return _the number of ways to tile an_ `2 x n` _board_.
Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different
if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such
that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.



**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 3
> 
> Output: 5
> 
> Explanation: The five different ways are show above.

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 1
> 
> Output: 1

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 1000`
