# [2101. Detonate the Maximum Bombs](https://leetcode.com/problems/detonate-the-maximum-bombs/)

## 题目

You are given a list of bombs. The **range** of a bomb is defined as the area
where its effect can be felt. This area is in the shape of a **circle** with
the center as the location of the bomb.

The bombs are represented by a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `bombs` where
`bombs[i] = [xi, yi, ri]`. `xi` and `yi` denote the X-coordinate and
Y-coordinate of the location of the `ith` bomb, whereas `ri` denotes the
**radius** of its range.

You may choose to detonate a **single** bomb. When a bomb is detonated, it
will detonate **all bombs** that lie in its range. These bombs will further
detonate the bombs that lie in their ranges.

Given the list of `bombs`, return _the **maximum** number of bombs that can be
detonated if you are allowed to detonate **only one** bomb_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/06/desmos-eg-3.png)

> Input: bombs = [[2,1,3],[6,1,4]]
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation:
>
> The above figure shows the positions and ranges of the 2 bombs.
>
> If we detonate the left bomb, the right bomb will not be affected.
>
> But if we detonate the right bomb, both bombs will be detonated.
>
> So the maximum bombs that can be detonated is max(1, 2) = 2.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/06/desmos-eg-2.png)

> Input: bombs = [[1,1,5],[10,10,5]]
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation: Detonating either bomb will not detonate the other bomb, so the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated is 1.

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/07/desmos-eg1.png)

> Input: bombs = [[1,2,3],[2,3,1],[3,4,2],[4,5,3],[5,6,4]]
>
> Output: 5
>
> Explanation:
>
> The best bomb to detonate is bomb 0 because:
>
> - Bomb 0 detonates bombs 1 and 2. The red circle denotes the range of bomb 0.
> - Bomb 2 detonates bomb 3. The blue circle denotes the range of bomb 2.
> - Bomb 3 detonates bomb 4. The green circle denotes the range of bomb 3.
>
> Thus all 5 bombs are detonated.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= bombs.length <= 100`
- `bombs[i].length == 3`
- `1 <= xi, yi, ri <= 10^5`
