# [1455. Check If a Word Occurs As a Prefix of Any Word in a Sentence](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-a-word-occurs-as-a-prefix-of-any-word-in-a-sentence/)

## 题目

Given a `sentence` that consists of some words separated by a **single space**
, and a `searchWord`, check if `searchWord` is a prefix of any word in
`sentence`.

Return _the index of the word in_`sentence` _( **1-indexed** ) where
_`searchWord` _is a prefix of this word_. If `searchWord` is a prefix of more
than one word, return the index of the first word **(minimum index)**. If
there is no such word return `-1`.

A **prefix** of a string `s` is any leading contiguous substring of `s`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: sentence = "i love eating burger", searchWord = "burg"
>
> Output: 4
>
> Explanation: "burg" is prefix of "burger" which is the 4th word in the sentence.

**Example 2:**

> Input: sentence = "this problem is an easy problem", searchWord = "pro"
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: "pro" is prefix of "problem" which is the 2nd and the 6th word in the sentence, but we return 2 as it's the minimal index.

**Example 3:**

> Input: sentence = "i am tired", searchWord = "you"
>
> Output: -1
>
> Explanation: "you" is not a prefix of any word in the sentence.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= sentence.length <= 100`
- `1 <= searchWord.length <= 10`
- `sentence` consists of lowercase English letters and spaces.
- `searchWord` consists of lowercase English letters.
