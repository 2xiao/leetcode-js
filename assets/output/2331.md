# [2331. Evaluate Boolean Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-boolean-binary-tree)

## 题目

You are given the `root` of a **full binary tree** with the following
properties:

  * **Leaf nodes** have either the value `0` or `1`, where `0` represents `False` and `1` represents `True`.
  * **Non-leaf nodes** have either the value `2` or `3`, where `2` represents the boolean `OR` and `3` represents the boolean `AND`.

The **evaluation** of a node is as follows:

  * If the node is a leaf node, the evaluation is the **value** of the node, i.e. `True` or `False`.
  * Otherwise, **evaluate** the node's two children and **apply** the boolean operation of its value with the children's evaluations.

Return _the boolean result of **evaluating** the _`root` _node._

A **full binary tree** is a binary tree where each node has either `0` or `2`
children.

A **leaf node** is a node that has zero children.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/05/16/example1drawio1.png)

> Input: root = [2,1,3,null,null,0,1]
> 
> Output: true
> 
> Explanation: The above diagram illustrates the evaluation process.
> 
> The AND node evaluates to False AND True = False.
> 
> The OR node evaluates to True OR False = True.
> 
> The root node evaluates to True, so we return true.

**Example 2:**

> Input: root = [0]
> 
> Output: false
> 
> Explanation: The root node is a leaf node and it evaluates to false, so we return false.

**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
  * `0 <= Node.val <= 3`
  * Every node has either `0` or `2` children.
  * Leaf nodes have a value of `0` or `1`.
  * Non-leaf nodes have a value of `2` or `3`.
