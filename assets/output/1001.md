# [1001. Grid Illumination](https://leetcode.com/problems/grid-illumination)

## 题目

There is a 2D `grid` of size `n x n` where each cell of this grid has a lamp
that is initially **turned off**.

You are given a 2D array of lamp positions `lamps`, where `lamps[i] = [rowi,
coli]` indicates that the lamp at `grid[rowi][coli]` is **turned on**. Even if
the same lamp is listed more than once, it is turned on.

When a lamp is turned on, it **illuminates its cell** and **all other cells**
in the same **row, column, or diagonal**.

You are also given another 2D array `queries`, where `queries[j] = [rowj,
colj]`. For the `jth` query, determine whether `grid[rowj][colj]` is
illuminated or not. After answering the `jth` query, **turn off** the lamp at
`grid[rowj][colj]` and its **8 adjacent lamps** if they exist. A lamp is
adjacent if its cell shares either a side or corner with `grid[rowj][colj]`.

Return _an array of integers_`ans` _,_ _where_`ans[j]` _should be_`1` _if the
cell in the_`jth` _query was illuminated, or_`0` _if the lamp was not._



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** n = 5, lamps = [[0,0],[4,4]], queries = [[1,1],[1,0]]
    **Output:** [1,0]
    **Explanation:** We have the initial grid with all lamps turned off. In the above picture we see the grid after turning on the lamp at grid[0][0] then turning on the lamp at grid[4][4].
    The 0th query asks if the lamp at grid[1][1] is illuminated or not (the blue square). It is illuminated, so set ans[0] = 1. Then, we turn off all lamps in the red square.

    The 1st query asks if the lamp at grid[1][0] is illuminated or not (the blue square). It is not illuminated, so set ans[1] = 0. Then, we turn off all lamps in the red rectangle.

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 5, lamps = [[0,0],[4,4]], queries = [[1,1],[1,1]]
    **Output:** [1,1]
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 5, lamps = [[0,0],[0,4]], queries = [[0,4],[0,1],[1,4]]
    **Output:** [1,1,0]
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 109`
  * `0 <= lamps.length <= 20000`
  * `0 <= queries.length <= 20000`
  * `lamps[i].length == 2`
  * `0 <= rowi, coli < n`
  * `queries[j].length == 2`
  * `0 <= rowj, colj < n`
