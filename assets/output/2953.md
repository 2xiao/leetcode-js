# [2953. Count Complete Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-substrings/)

## 题目

You are given a string `word` and an integer `k`.

A substring `s` of `word` is **complete** if:

  * Each character in `s` occurs **exactly** `k` times.
  * The difference between two adjacent characters is **at most** `2`. That is, for any two adjacent characters `c1` and `c2` in `s`, the absolute difference in their positions in the alphabet is **at most** `2`.

Return _the number of **complete** substrings of_ `word`.

A **substring** is a **non-empty** contiguous sequence of characters in a
string.



**Example 1:**

> Input: word = "igigee", k = 2
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation: The complete substrings where each character appears exactly twice and the difference between adjacent characters is at most 2 are: _**igig**_ ee, igig _ **ee**_ , _**igigee**_.

**Example 2:**

> Input: word = "aaabbbccc", k = 3
> 
> Output: 6
> 
> Explanation: The complete substrings where each character appears exactly three times and the difference between adjacent characters is at most 2 are: **_aaa_** bbbccc, aaa _ **bbb**_ ccc, aaabbb _ **ccc**_ , **_aaabbb_** ccc, aaa _ **bbbccc**_ , _**aaabbbccc**_.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= word.length <= 105`
  * `word` consists only of lowercase English letters.
  * `1 <= k <= word.length`
