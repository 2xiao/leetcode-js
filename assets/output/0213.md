# [213. House Robber II](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii)

## 题目

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each
house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are
**arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the
last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and
**it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken
into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house,
return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the
police**_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [2,3,2]
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [1,2,3,1]
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
    Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [1,2,3]
    **Output:** 3
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
  * `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
