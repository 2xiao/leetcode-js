# [1916. Count Ways to Build Rooms in an Ant Colony](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-ways-to-build-rooms-in-an-ant-colony)

## 题目

You are an ant tasked with adding `n` new rooms numbered `0` to `n-1` to your
colony. You are given the expansion plan as a **0-indexed** integer array of
length `n`, `prevRoom`, where `prevRoom[i]` indicates that you must build room
`prevRoom[i]` before building room `i`, and these two rooms must be connected
**directly**. Room `0` is already built, so `prevRoom[0] = -1`. The expansion
plan is given such that once all the rooms are built, every room will be
reachable from room `0`.

You can only build **one room** at a time, and you can travel freely between
rooms you have **already built** only if they are **connected**. You can
choose to build **any room** as long as its **previous room**  is already
built.

Return _the **number of different orders** you can build all the rooms in_.
Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/19/d1.JPG)

    
    
    **Input:** prevRoom = [-1,0,1]
    **Output:** 1
    **Explanation:**  There is only one way to build the additional rooms: 0 -> 1 -> 2
    

**Example 2:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/19/d2.JPG)**

    
    
    **Input:** prevRoom = [-1,0,0,1,2]
    **Output:** 6
    **Explanation:** The 6 ways are:
    0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4
    0 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3
    0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
    0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3
    0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4
    0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3
    



**Constraints:**

  * `n == prevRoom.length`
  * `2 <= n <= 105`
  * `prevRoom[0] == -1`
  * `0 <= prevRoom[i] < n` for all `1 <= i < n`
  * Every room is reachable from room `0` once all the rooms are built.
