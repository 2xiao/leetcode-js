# [1051. Height Checker](https://leetcode.com/problems/height-checker)

## 题目

A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students
are asked to stand in a single file line in **non-decreasing order** by
height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array `expected` where
`expected[i]` is the expected height of the `ith` student in line.

You are given an integer array `heights` representing the **current order**
that the students are standing in. Each `heights[i]` is the height of the
`ith` student in line ( **0-indexed** ).

Return _the **number of indices** where _`heights[i] != expected[i]`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation: 
> 
> heights:  [1,1, _4_ ,2, _1_ , _3_ ]
> 
> expected: [1,1, _1_ ,2, _3_ , _4_ ]
> 
> Indices 2, 4, and 5 do not match.

**Example 2:**

> Input: heights = [5,1,2,3,4]
> 
> Output: 5
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> heights:  [ _5_ , _1_ , _2_ , _3_ , _4_ ]
> 
> expected: [ _1_ , _2_ , _3_ , _4_ , _5_ ]
> 
> All indices do not match.

**Example 3:**

> Input: heights = [1,2,3,4,5]
> 
> Output: 0
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> heights:  [1,2,3,4,5]
> 
> expected: [1,2,3,4,5]
> 
> All indices match.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= heights.length <= 100`
  * `1 <= heights[i] <= 100`
