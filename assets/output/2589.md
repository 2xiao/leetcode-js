# [2589. Minimum Time to Complete All Tasks](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-complete-all-tasks)

## 题目

There is a computer that can run an unlimited number of tasks **at the same
time**. You are given a 2D integer array `tasks` where `tasks[i] = [starti,
endi, durationi]` indicates that the `ith` task should run for a total of
`durationi` seconds (not necessarily continuous) within the **inclusive** time
range `[starti, endi]`.

You may turn on the computer only when it needs to run a task. You can also
turn it off if it is idle.

Return _the minimum time during which the computer should be turned on to
complete all tasks_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** tasks = [[2,3,1],[4,5,1],[1,5,2]]
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** 
    - The first task can be run in the inclusive time range [2, 2].
    - The second task can be run in the inclusive time range [5, 5].
    - The third task can be run in the two inclusive time ranges [2, 2] and [5, 5].
    The computer will be on for a total of 2 seconds.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** tasks = [[1,3,2],[2,5,3],[5,6,2]]
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** 
    - The first task can be run in the inclusive time range [2, 3].
    - The second task can be run in the inclusive time ranges [2, 3] and [5, 5].
    - The third task can be run in the two inclusive time range [5, 6].
    The computer will be on for a total of 4 seconds.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= tasks.length <= 2000`
  * `tasks[i].length == 3`
  * `1 <= starti, endi <= 2000`
  * `1 <= durationi <= endi - starti + 1 `
