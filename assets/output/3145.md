# [3145. Find Products of Elements of Big Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-products-of-elements-of-big-array/)

## 题目

The **powerful array** of a non-negative integer `x` is defined as the
shortest sorted array of powers of two that sum up to `x`. The table below
illustrates examples of how the **powerful array** is determined. It can be
proven that the powerful array of `x` is unique.

| num | Binary Representation | powerful array |
| --- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| 1   | 0000 _1_              | [1]            |
| 8   | 0 _1_ 000             | [8]            |
| 10  | 0 _1_ 0 _1_ 0         | [2, 8]         |
| 13  | 0 _11_ 0 _1_          | [1, 4, 8]      |
| 23  | _1_ 0 _111_           | [1, 2, 4, 16]  |

The array `big_nums` is created by concatenating the **powerful arrays** for
every positive integer `i` in ascending order: 1, 2, 3, and so on. Thus,
`big_nums` begins as `[_1_ , _2_ , _1, 2_ , _4_ , _1, 4_ , _2, 4_ , _1, 2, 4_
, _8_ , ...]`.

You are given a 2D integer matrix `queries`, where for `queries[i] = [fromi,
toi, modi]` you should calculate `(big*nums[fromi] * big*nums[fromi + 1] * ...

- big_nums[toi]) % modi`.

Return an integer array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is the answer to the
`ith` query.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** queries = [[1,3,7]]

**Output:** [4]

**Explanation:**

There is one query.

`big_nums[1..3] = [2,1,2]`. The product of them is 4. The result is `4 % 7 =
4.`

**Example 2:**

**Input:** queries = [[2,5,3],[7,7,4]]

**Output:** [2,2]

**Explanation:**

There are two queries.

First query: `big_nums[2..5] = [1,2,4,1]`. The product of them is 8. The
result is `8 % 3 = 2`.

Second query: `big_nums[7] = 2`. The result is `2 % 4 = 2`.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= queries.length <= 500`
- `queries[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= queries[i][0] <= queries[i][1] <= 1015`
- `1 <= queries[i][2] <= 10^5`
