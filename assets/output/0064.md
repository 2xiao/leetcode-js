# [64. Minimum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/)

## 题目

Given a `m x n` `grid` filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top
left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

**Note:** You can only move either down or right at any point in time.



**Example 1:**

> Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
> 
> Output: 7
> 
> Explanation: Because the path 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 minimizes the sum.

**Example 2:**

> Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
> 
> Output: 12

**Constraints:**

  * `m == grid.length`
  * `n == grid[i].length`
  * `1 <= m, n <= 200`
  * `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 200`
