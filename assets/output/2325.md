# [2325. Decode the Message](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-the-message)

## 题目

You are given the strings `key` and `message`, which represent a cipher key
and a secret message, respectively. The steps to decode `message` are as
follows:

  1. Use the **first** appearance of all 26 lowercase English letters in `key` as the **order** of the substitution table.
  2. Align the substitution table with the regular English alphabet.
  3. Each letter in `message` is then **substituted** using the table.
  4. Spaces `' '` are transformed to themselves.

  * For example, given `key = " _ **hap**_ p _ **y**_ _**bo**_ y"` (actual key would have **at least one** instance of each letter in the alphabet), we have the partial substitution table of (`'h' -> 'a'`, `'a' -> 'b'`, `'p' -> 'c'`, `'y' -> 'd'`, `'b' -> 'e'`, `'o' -> 'f'`).

Return _the decoded message_.



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** key = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", message = "vkbs bs t suepuv"
    **Output:** "this is a secret"
    **Explanation:** The diagram above shows the substitution table.
    It is obtained by taking the first appearance of each letter in " _ **the**_ _**quick**_ _**brown**_ _**f**_ o _ **x**_ _**j**_ u _ **mps**_ o _ **v**_ er the _**lazy**_ _**d**_ o _ **g**_ ".
    

**Example 2:**

    **Input:** key = "eljuxhpwnyrdgtqkviszcfmabo", message = "zwx hnfx lqantp mnoeius ycgk vcnjrdb"
    **Output:** "the five boxing wizards jump quickly"
    **Explanation:** The diagram above shows the substitution table.
    It is obtained by taking the first appearance of each letter in " _ **eljuxhpwnyrdgtqkviszcfmabo**_ ".
    



**Constraints:**

  * `26 <= key.length <= 2000`
  * `key` consists of lowercase English letters and `' '`.
  * `key` contains every letter in the English alphabet (`'a'` to `'z'`) **at least once**.
  * `1 <= message.length <= 2000`
  * `message` consists of lowercase English letters and `' '`.
