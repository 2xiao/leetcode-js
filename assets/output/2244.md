# [2244. Minimum Rounds to Complete All Tasks](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-rounds-to-complete-all-tasks/)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `tasks`, where `tasks[i]`
represents the difficulty level of a task. In each round, you can complete
either 2 or 3 tasks of the **same difficulty level**.

Return _the **minimum** rounds required to complete all the tasks, or _`-1`
_if it is not possible to complete all the tasks._



**Example 1:**

> Input: tasks = [2,2,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4]
> 
> Output: 4
> 
> Explanation: To complete all the tasks, a possible plan is:
> - In the first round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 2. 
> - In the second round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 3. 
> - In the third round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 4. 
> - In the fourth round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 4.  
> 
> It can be shown that all the tasks cannot be completed in fewer than 4 rounds, so the answer is 4.

**Example 2:**

> Input: tasks = [2,3,3]
> 
> Output: -1
> 
> Explanation: There is only 1 task of difficulty level 2, but in each round, you can only complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the same difficulty level. Hence, you cannot complete all the tasks, and the answer is -1.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= tasks.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= tasks[i] <= 109`
