# [1529. Minimum Suffix Flips](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-suffix-flips/)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** binary string `target` of length `n`. You have
another binary string `s` of length `n` that is initially set to all zeros.
You want to make `s` equal to `target`.

In one operation, you can pick an index `i` where `0 <= i < n` and flip all
bits in the **inclusive** range `[i, n - 1]`. Flip means changing `'0'` to
`'1'` and `'1'` to `'0'`.

Return _the minimum number of operations needed to make_`s` _equal
to_`target`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: target = "10111"
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: Initially, s = "00000".
>
> Choose index i = 2: "00 _000_ " -> "00 _111_ "
>
> Choose index i = 0: " _00111_ " -> " _11000_ "
>
> Choose index i = 1: "1 _1000_ " -> "1 _0111_ "
>
> We need at least 3 flip operations to form target.

**Example 2:**

> Input: target = "101"
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: Initially, s = "000".
>
> Choose index i = 0: " _000_ " -> " _111_ "
>
> Choose index i = 1: "1 _11_ " -> "1 _00_ "
>
> Choose index i = 2: "10 _0_ " -> "10 _1_ "
>
> We need at least 3 flip operations to form target.

**Example 3:**

> Input: target = "00000"
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation: We do not need any operations since the initial s already equals target.

**Constraints:**

- `n == target.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `target[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
