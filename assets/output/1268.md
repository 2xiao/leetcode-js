# [1268. Search Suggestions System](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-suggestions-system/)

## 题目

You are given an array of strings `products` and a string `searchWord`.

Design a system that suggests at most three product names from `products`
after each character of `searchWord` is typed. Suggested products should have
common prefix with `searchWord`. If there are more than three products with a
common prefix return the three lexicographically minimums products.

Return _a list of lists of the suggested products after each character
of_`searchWord` _is typed_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: products = ["mobile","mouse","moneypot","monitor","mousepad"], searchWord = "mouse"
>
> Output: [["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],["mouse","mousepad"],["mouse","mousepad"],["mouse","mousepad"]]
>
> Explanation: products sorted lexicographically = ["mobile","moneypot","monitor","mouse","mousepad"].
>
> After typing m and mo all products match and we show user ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"].
>
> After typing mou, mous and mouse the system suggests ["mouse","mousepad"].

**Example 2:**

> Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "havana"
>
> Output: [["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"]]
>
> Explanation: The only word "havana" will be always suggested while typing the search word.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= products.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= products[i].length <= 3000`
- `1 <= sum(products[i].length) <= 2 * 10^4`
- All the strings of `products` are **unique**.
- `products[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= searchWord.length <= 1000`
- `searchWord` consists of lowercase English letters.
