# [2708. Maximum Strength of a Group](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-strength-of-a-group/)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` representing the score of
students in an exam. The teacher would like to form one **non-empty** group of
students with maximal **strength** , where the strength of a group of students
of indices `i0`, `i1`, `i2`, ... , `ik` is defined as `nums[i0] * nums[i1] *
nums[i2] * ... * nums[ik​]`.

Return _the maximum strength of a group the teacher can create_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [3,-1,-5,2,5,-9]
> 
> Output: 1350
> 
> Explanation: One way to form a group of maximal strength is to group the students at indices [0,2,3,4,5]. Their strength is 3 * (-5) * 2 * 5 * (-9) = 1350, which we can show is optimal.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [-4,-5,-4]
> 
> Output: 20
> 
> Explanation: Group the students at indices [0, 1] . Then, we'll have a resulting strength of 20. We cannot achieve greater strength.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 13`
  * `-9 <= nums[i] <= 9`
