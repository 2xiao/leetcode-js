# [2172. Maximum AND Sum of Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-and-sum-of-array/)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `numSlots`
such that `2 * numSlots >= n`. There are `numSlots` slots numbered from `1` to
`numSlots`.

You have to place all `n` integers into the slots such that each slot contains
at **most** two numbers. The **AND sum** of a given placement is the sum of
the **bitwise** `AND` of every number with its respective slot number.

  * For example, the **AND sum** of placing the numbers `[1, 3]` into slot _`1`_ and `[4, 6]` into slot _`2`_ is equal to `(1 AND _1_ ) + (3 AND _1_ ) + (4 AND _2_ ) + (6 AND _2_ ) = 1 + 1 + 0 + 2 = 4`.

Return _the maximum possible **AND sum** of _`nums` _given_`numSlots` _slots._



**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6], numSlots = 3
> 
> Output: 9
> 
> Explanation: One possible placement is [1, 4] into slot _1_ , [2, 6] into slot _2_ , and [3, 5] into slot _3_. 
> 
> This gives the maximum AND sum of (1 AND _1_ ) + (4 AND _1_ ) + (2 AND _2_ ) + (6 AND _2_ ) + (3 AND _3_ ) + (5 AND _3_ ) = 1 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 9.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [1,3,10,4,7,1], numSlots = 9
> 
> Output: 24
> 
> Explanation: One possible placement is [1, 1] into slot _1_ , [3] into slot _3_ , [4] into slot _4_ , [7] into slot _7_ , and [10] into slot _9_.
> 
> This gives the maximum AND sum of (1 AND _1_ ) + (1 AND _1_ ) + (3 AND _3_ ) + (4 AND _4_ ) + (7 AND _7_ ) + (10 AND _9_ ) = 1 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 8 = 24.
> 
> Note that slots 2, 5, 6, and 8 are empty which is permitted.

**Constraints:**

  * `n == nums.length`
  * `1 <= numSlots <= 9`
  * `1 <= n <= 2 * numSlots`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 15`
