# [1901. Find a Peak Element II](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-a-peak-element-ii/)

## 题目

A **peak** element in a 2D grid is an element that is **strictly greater**
than all of its **adjacent** neighbors to the left, right, top, and bottom.

Given a **0-indexed** `m x n` matrix `mat` where **no two adjacent cells are
equal** , find **any** peak element `mat[i][j]` and return _the length 2
array_`[i,j]`.

You may assume that the entire matrix is surrounded by an **outer perimeter**
with the value `-1` in each cell.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(m log(n))` or `O(n log(m))` time.

**Example 1:**

> Input: mat = [[1,4],[3,2]]
>
> Output: [0,1]
>
> Explanation: Both 3 and 4 are peak elements so [1,0] and [0,1] are both acceptable answers.

**Example 2:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/07/3.png)**

> Input: mat = [[10,20,15],[21,30,14],[7,16,32]]
>
> Output: [1,1]
>
> Explanation: Both 30 and 32 are peak elements so [1,1] and [2,2] are both acceptable answers.

**Constraints:**

- `m == mat.length`
- `n == mat[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 500`
- `1 <= mat[i][j] <= 10^5`
- No two adjacent cells are equal.
