# [1535. Find the Winner of an Array Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-winner-of-an-array-game)

## 题目

Given an integer array `arr` of **distinct** integers and an integer `k`.

A game will be played between the first two elements of the array (i.e.
`arr[0]` and `arr[1]`). In each round of the game, we compare `arr[0]` with
`arr[1]`, the larger integer wins and remains at position `0`, and the smaller
integer moves to the end of the array. The game ends when an integer wins `k`
consecutive rounds.

Return _the integer which will win the game_.

It is **guaranteed** that there will be a winner of the game.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** arr = [2,1,3,5,4,6,7], k = 2
    **Output:** 5
    **Explanation:** Let's see the rounds of the game:
    Round |       arr       | winner | win_count
      1   | [2,1,3,5,4,6,7] | 2      | 1
      2   | [2,3,5,4,6,7,1] | 3      | 1
      3   | [3,5,4,6,7,1,2] | 5      | 1
      4   | [5,4,6,7,1,2,3] | 5      | 2
    So we can see that 4 rounds will be played and 5 is the winner because it wins 2 consecutive games.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** arr = [3,2,1], k = 10
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** 3 will win the first 10 rounds consecutively.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= arr.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= arr[i] <= 106`
  * `arr` contains **distinct** integers.
  * `1 <= k <= 109`
