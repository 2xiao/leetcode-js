# [2584. Split the Array to Make Coprime Products](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-the-array-to-make-coprime-products)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n`.

A **split** at an index `i` where `0 <= i <= n - 2` is called **valid** if the
product of the first `i + 1` elements and the product of the remaining
elements are coprime.

  * For example, if `nums = [2, 3, 3]`, then a split at the index `i = 0` is valid because `2` and `9` are coprime, while a split at the index `i = 1` is not valid because `6` and `3` are not coprime. A split at the index `i = 2` is not valid because `i == n - 1`.

Return _the smallest index_`i` _at which the array can be split validly
or_`-1` _if there is no such split_.

Two values `val1` and `val2` are coprime if `gcd(val1, val2) == 1` where
`gcd(val1, val2)` is the greatest common divisor of `val1` and `val2`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [4,7,8,15,3,5]
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: The table above shows the values of the product of the first i + 1 elements, the remaining elements, and their gcd at each index i.
> 
> The only valid split is at index 2.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [4,7,15,8,3,5]
> 
> Output: -1
> 
> Explanation: The table above shows the values of the product of the first i + 1 elements, the remaining elements, and their gcd at each index i.
> 
> There is no valid split.

**Constraints:**

  * `n == nums.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 104`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 106`
