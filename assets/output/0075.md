# [75. Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)

## 题目

Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them
**[in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) **so that
objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red,
white, and blue.

We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white,
and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.



**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
> 
> Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [2,0,1]
> 
> Output: [0,1,2]

**Constraints:**

  * `n == nums.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 300`
  * `nums[i]` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`.



**Follow up:**  Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only
constant extra space?
