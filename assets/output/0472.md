# [472. Concatenated Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/concatenated-words/)

## 题目

Given an array of strings `words` ( **without duplicates** ), return _all the
**concatenated words** in the given list of_ `words`.

A **concatenated word** is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of
at least two shorter words (not necessarily distinct) in the given array.



**Example 1:**

> Input: words = ["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]
> 
> Output: ["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog","ratcatdogcat"]
> 
> Explanation: "catsdogcats" can be concatenated by "cats", "dog" and "cats"; 
> 
> "dogcatsdog" can be concatenated by "dog", "cats" and "dog"; 
> 
> "ratcatdogcat" can be concatenated by "rat", "cat", "dog" and "cat".

**Example 2:**

> Input: words = ["cat","dog","catdog"]
> 
> Output: ["catdog"]

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= words.length <= 104`
  * `1 <= words[i].length <= 30`
  * `words[i]` consists of only lowercase English letters.
  * All the strings of `words` are **unique**.
  * `1 <= sum(words[i].length) <= 105`
