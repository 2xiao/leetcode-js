# [1234. Replace the Substring for Balanced String](https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-the-substring-for-balanced-string/)

## 题目

You are given a string s of length `n` containing only four kinds of
characters: `'Q'`, `'W'`, `'E'`, and `'R'`.

A string is said to be **balanced** __ if each of its characters appears `n /
4` times where `n` is the length of the string.

Return _the minimum length of the substring that can be replaced with **any**
other string of the same length to make _`s` _**balanced**_. If s is already
**balanced** , return `0`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "QWER"
> 
> Output: 0
> 
> Explanation: s is already balanced.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "QQWE"
> 
> Output: 1
> 
> Explanation: We need to replace a 'Q' to 'R', so that "RQWE" (or "QRWE") is balanced.

**Example 3:**

> Input: s = "QQQW"
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: We can replace the first "QQ" to "ER". 

**Constraints:**

  * `n == s.length`
  * `4 <= n <= 105`
  * `n` is a multiple of `4`.
  * `s` contains only `'Q'`, `'W'`, `'E'`, and `'R'`.
