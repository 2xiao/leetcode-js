# [1636. Sort Array by Increasing Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-array-by-increasing-frequency)

## 题目

Given an array of integers `nums`, sort the array in **increasing** order
based on the frequency of the values. If multiple values have the same
frequency, sort them in **decreasing** order.

Return the _sorted array_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [1,1,2,2,2,3]
> 
> Output: [3,1,1,2,2,2]
> 
> Explanation: '3' has a frequency of 1, '1' has a frequency of 2, and '2' has a frequency of 3.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [2,3,1,3,2]
> 
> Output: [1,3,3,2,2]
> 
> Explanation: '2' and '3' both have a frequency of 2, so they are sorted in decreasing order.

**Example 3:**

> Input: nums = [-1,1,-6,4,5,-6,1,4,1]
> 
> Output: [5,-1,4,4,-6,-6,1,1,1]



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
  * `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`
