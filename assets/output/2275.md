# [2275. Largest Combination With Bitwise AND Greater Than Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-combination-with-bitwise-and-greater-than-zero/)

## 题目

The **bitwise AND** of an array `nums` is the bitwise AND of all integers in
`nums`.

- For example, for `nums = [1, 5, 3]`, the bitwise AND is equal to `1 & 5 & 3 = 1`.
- Also, for `nums = [7]`, the bitwise AND is `7`.

You are given an array of positive integers `candidates`. Evaluate the
**bitwise AND** of every **combination** of numbers of `candidates`. Each
number in `candidates` may only be used **once** in each combination.

Return _the size of the **largest** combination of _`candidates` _with a
bitwise AND **greater** than _`0`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: candidates = [16,17,71,62,12,24,14]
>
> Output: 4
>
> Explanation: The combination [16,17,62,24] has a bitwise AND of 16 & 17 & 62 & 24 = 16 > 0.
>
> The size of the combination is 4.
>
> It can be shown that no combination with a size greater than 4 has a bitwise AND greater than 0.
>
> Note that more than one combination may have the largest size.
>
> For example, the combination [62,12,24,14] has a bitwise AND of 62 & 12 & 24 & 14 = 8 > 0.

**Example 2:**

> Input: candidates = [8,8]
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: The largest combination [8,8] has a bitwise AND of 8 & 8 = 8 > 0.
>
> The size of the combination is 2, so we return 2.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= candidates.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= candidates[i] <= 10^7`
