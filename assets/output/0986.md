# [986. Interval List Intersections](https://leetcode.com/problems/interval-list-intersections/)

## 题目

You are given two lists of closed intervals, `firstList` and `secondList`,
where `firstList[i] = [starti, endi]` and `secondList[j] = [startj, endj]`.
Each list of intervals is pairwise **disjoint** and in **sorted order**.

Return _the intersection of these two interval lists_.

A **closed interval** `[a, b]` (with `a <= b`) denotes the set of real numbers
`x` with `a <= x <= b`.

The **intersection** of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are
either empty or represented as a closed interval. For example, the
intersection of `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]` is `[2, 3]`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/30/interval1.png)

> Input: firstList = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], secondList = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]
>
> Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]

**Example 2:**

> Input: firstList = [[1,3],[5,9]], secondList = []
>
> Output: []

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= firstList.length, secondList.length <= 1000`
- `firstList.length + secondList.length >= 1`
- `0 <= starti < endi <= 10^9`
- `endi < starti+1`
- `0 <= startj < endj <= 10^9 `
- `endj < startj+1`
