# [151. Reverse Words in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string)

## 题目

Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the **words**.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in
`s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return _a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single
space._

**Note** that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces
between two words. The returned string should only have a single space
separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "the sky is blue"
    **Output:** "blue is sky the"
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "  hello world  "
    **Output:** "world hello"
    **Explanation:** Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "a good   example"
    **Output:** "example good a"
    **Explanation:** You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 104`
  * `s` contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces `' '`.
  * There is **at least one** word in `s`.



**Follow-up:  **If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you
solve it  **in-place**  with `O(1)` extra space?
