# [501. Find Mode in Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-mode-in-binary-search-tree/)

## 题目

Given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, return _all
the[mode(s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_\(statistics\)) (i.e., the
most frequently occurred element) in it\_.

If the tree has more than one mode, return them in **any order**.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than or equal to** the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than or equal to** the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

**Example 1:**

> Input: root = [1,null,2,2]
>
> Output: [2]

**Example 2:**

> Input: root = [0]
>
> Output: [0]

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`

**Follow up:** Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that
the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).
