# [1957. Delete Characters to Make Fancy String](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-characters-to-make-fancy-string/)

## 题目

A **fancy string** is a string where no **three** **consecutive** characters
are equal.

Given a string `s`, delete the **minimum** possible number of characters from
`s` to make it **fancy**.

Return _the final string after the deletion_. It can be shown that the answer
will always be **unique**.



**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "le _e_ etcode"
> 
> Output: "leetcode"
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> Remove an 'e' from the first group of 'e's to create "leetcode".
> 
> No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "leetcode".

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = " _a_ aab _aa_ aa"
> 
> Output: "aabaa"
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> Remove an 'a' from the first group of 'a's to create "aabaaaa".
> 
> Remove two 'a's from the second group of 'a's to create "aabaa".
> 
> No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "aabaa".

**Example 3:**

> Input: s = "aab"
> 
> Output: "aab"
> 
> Explanation: No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "aab".

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
