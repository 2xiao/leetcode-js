# [692. Top K Frequent Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-words/)

## 题目

Given an array of strings `words` and an integer `k`, return _the_`k` _most
frequent strings_.

Return the answer **sorted** by **the frequency** from highest to lowest. Sort
the words with the same frequency by their **lexicographical order**.

**Example 1:**

> Input: words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
>
> Output: ["i","love"]
>
> Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
>
> Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.

**Example 2:**

> Input: words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4
>
> Output: ["the","is","sunny","day"]
>
> Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 500`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
- `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `k` is in the range `[1, The number of **unique** words[i]]`

**Follow-up:** Could you solve it in `O(n log(k))` time and `O(n)` extra
space?
