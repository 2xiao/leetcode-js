# [335. Self Crossing](https://leetcode.com/problems/self-crossing)

## 题目

You are given an array of integers `distance`.

You start at the point `(0, 0)` on an **X-Y plane,** and you move
`distance[0]` meters to the north, then `distance[1]` meters to the west,
`distance[2]` meters to the south, `distance[3]` meters to the east, and so
on. In other words, after each move, your direction changes counter-clockwise.

Return `true` _if your path crosses itself or_`false` _if it does not_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: distance = [2,1,1,2]
> 
> Output: true
> 
> Explanation: The path crosses itself at the point (0, 1).

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/12/21/22.jpg)

> Input: distance = [1,2,3,4]
> 
> Output: false
> 
> Explanation: The path does not cross itself at any point.

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/12/21/33.jpg)

> Input: distance = [1,1,1,2,1]
> 
> Output: true
> 
> Explanation: The path crosses itself at the point (0, 0).

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= distance.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= distance[i] <= 105`
