# [2074. Reverse Nodes in Even Length Groups](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-even-length-groups)

## 题目

You are given the `head` of a linked list.

The nodes in the linked list are **sequentially** assigned to **non-empty**
groups whose lengths form the sequence of the natural numbers (`1, 2, 3, 4,
...`). The **length** of a group is the number of nodes assigned to it. In
other words,

  * The `1st` node is assigned to the first group.
  * The `2nd` and the `3rd` nodes are assigned to the second group.
  * The `4th`, `5th`, and `6th` nodes are assigned to the third group, and so on.

Note that the length of the last group may be less than or equal to `1 + the
length of the second to last group`.

**Reverse** the nodes in each group with an **even** length, and return _the_
`head` _of the modified linked list_.



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** head = [5,2,6,3,9,1,7,3,8,4]
    **Output:** [5,6,2,3,9,1,4,8,3,7]
    **Explanation:**
    - The length of the first group is 1, which is odd, hence no reversal occurs.
    - The length of the second group is 2, which is even, hence the nodes are reversed.
    - The length of the third group is 3, which is odd, hence no reversal occurs.
    - The length of the last group is 4, which is even, hence the nodes are reversed.
    

**Example 2:**

    **Input:** head = [1,1,0,6]
    **Output:** [1,0,1,6]
    **Explanation:**
    - The length of the first group is 1. No reversal occurs.
    - The length of the second group is 2. The nodes are reversed.
    - The length of the last group is 1. No reversal occurs.
    

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/17/ex3.png)

    
    
    **Input:** head = [1,1,0,6,5]
    **Output:** [1,0,1,5,6]
    **Explanation:**
    - The length of the first group is 1. No reversal occurs.
    - The length of the second group is 2. The nodes are reversed.
    - The length of the last group is 2. The nodes are reversed.
    



**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 105]`.
  * `0 <= Node.val <= 105`
